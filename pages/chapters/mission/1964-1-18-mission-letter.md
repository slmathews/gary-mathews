Dear Folks,

Well, I arrived in Buenos Aires all right. The trip was a little bit
rough at the end and I got a little bit sick. They have moved the
Mission Home into the new building and it is really nice.

We arrived at Buenos Aires about 3:00 in the afternoon. President Strong
met us and took us to the Mission Home. We were shown around and filled
out some papers and were given instructions. Friday morning we were
given more instructions and then went downtown to change our money to
pesos. Right after lunch we were given our assignments and met our
companions and took off. My companion is Elder George Wilbar of Castle
Dale, Utah. I am his first junior so we will have to learn together. We
are stationed at San Nicolas, a little farming town north of Buenos
Aires. It took us five and a half hours to get here by bus. We arrived
late last night and met the President of the Rama or branch and the two
other Elders who are working here in San Nicolas. They are building a
chapel and we will spend one or two days a week helping build it.

We are staying in a hotel and have to eat out but it is pretty clean and
well kept.

When I got down here I found all the mail I didn’t receive at Christmas.
I guess people didn’t know how long I would be at the Y.

The Country is really beautiful and the people are quite friendly and
wonderful. Buenos Aires was quite modern in some respects and quite
primitive in other respects according to American standards.

I have some more letters to write and not really anything to say so I
will close for now.

Love always, Gary
