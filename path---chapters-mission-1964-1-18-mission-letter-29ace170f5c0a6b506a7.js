The trip was a little bit\nrough at the end and I got a little bit sick. They have moved the\nMission Home into the new building and it is really nice.</p>\n<p>We arrived at Buenos Aires about 3:00 in the afternoon. President Strong\nmet us and took us to the Mission Home. We were shown around and filled\nout some papers and were given instructions. Friday morning we were\ngiven more instructions and then went downtown to change our money to\npesos. Right after lunch we were given our assignments and met our\ncompanions and took off. My companion is Elder George Wilbar of Castle\nDale, Utah. I am his first junior so we will have to learn together. We\nare stationed at San Nicolas, a little farming town north of Buenos\nAires. It took us five and a half hours to get here by bus. We arrived\nlate last night and met the President of the Rama or branch and the two\nother Elders who are working here in San Nicolas. They are building a\nchapel and we will spend one or two days a week helping build it.</p>\n<p>We are staying in a hotel and have to eat out but it is pretty clean and\nwell kept.</p>\n<p>When I got down here I found all the mail I didn’t receive at Christmas.\nI guess people didn’t know how long I would be at the Y.</p>\n<p>The Country is really beautiful and the people are quite friendly and\nwonderful. Buenos Aires was quite modern in some respects and quite\nprimitive in other respects according to American standards.</p>\n<p>I have some more letters to write and not really anything to say so I\nwill close for now.</p>\n<p>Love always, Gary</p>\n<p>P.S.</p>\n<p>My address is</p>\n<p>Elder Gary A.
