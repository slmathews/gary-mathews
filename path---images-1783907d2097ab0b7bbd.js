Because of the need for Chapels, there are five or six full-time missionaries working on Construction and they are calling all Argentine youths as labor missionaries and none anymore as proselyting missionaries.</p>\n<p>The food down here is really good, even if some is a lot different. We are living in a hotel and eat in Restaurants. We pay around $200 pesos a day for food which is about $1.50 and our room costs us $2250 pesos a month which is just under $20 for rent.</p>\n<p>The people here are really wonderful and friendly. Their customs are different and they speak a different language but they are the same as those in the states.</p>\n<p>Well, I am writing this during siesta time so if the letter is a little wrinkled, you will know why.</p>\n<p>I better close and send this off.</p>\n<p>Lots of love<br>\nAlways<br>\nGary</p>\n",date:"31 Jan 1964",year:"1964",sortable:"19640131"}},{node:{__typename:"Pdf",Caption:null,Description:"<p>February 10, 1964</p>\n<p>Dear Folks,</p>\n<p>I received your letter of the 1st today, so it took a little longer than usual. It was the fifth letter I have gotten since I have been down here – 3 from home, one from Sheryl, and one from Ilene &amp; Terry.</p>\n<p>If you want to include more in the letters. Ilene sent 4 pages, regular paper, 2 back &amp; front, and Sheryl sent 9 pages air mail paper for 15¢ air mail which is only 4¢ more.</p>\n<p>Since I have been here I have had many, many experiences. I have presented the first lesson to 2 groups of people. We have tracted about 600 doors. Had Group meetings in which we show the movie Qué es un Mormón (What is a Mormon). And last week started solely working directly with the members Building the confidence and knowledge in order that they will see better what their friends are missing, because it has gotten to the oint down here that Reuión de Grupe means I am busy to the members now. And last Sunday I baptized a lady that has been coming to Church for about a year but never was baptized. Her name is Juana Gillerma Gonzales de Bevilacqua. Last Monday we went to Rosario, a city of about 300,000 people to a Zone Conference. It is about 60 – 75 KM north of here. It was really a wonderful spiritual experience to partake of the Spirit of the other missionaries.</p>\n<p>Tuesday we worked on the construction. They don’t have any block companies in this town so we have been making block since I have been down here. They expect to finish making block this week and start laying it as soon as the plumbing is all in.</p>\n<p>I don’t know what I have told you about San Nicolas so I will just say everything now. San Nicolas is a town of 75 – 85,000 people. It is located north west of Buenos Aires on the edge of the campo or pampo. It is an important commercial city with the port of Siderurgia, where ships from all over the world stop.  There is a colony of around 50 families of U.S. birth outside of Siderurgia in one of the Barrios or Wards of the city. They work as technicians at the port and at a plastic plant here in San Nicolas. There are also lots of Germans, Italians, Japanese technicians here also. As far as Religion goes, Catholic is the main one, but there is a small Church of Christ, a Baptist missionary and a small Church founded on 12 apostles (the only other Church in the world with 12 apostles besides L.D.S.) and the L.D.S. Branch. The Rama or branch has a membership of around 200 – 250 members. It is one of the most active branches in the Mission. It includes people baptized in the 20’s &amp; 30’s up until strong converts baptized in the last year. Most of the young people are girls, especially if they are the only members in their families because of the customs and beliefs in chastity that are down here. It is hard to find a young person that has not broken the law of chastity.</p>\n<p>In the way of sports, the kids love “futbol” or soccer as we called it in the states and love to try basketball and volleyball. Although they don’t play the same grade of game, they love to play them. Movies they get from all over the world, U.S. with Spanish lettering at the bottom, German, French, English, Italian, &amp; Japanese. They have radios, T.V.’s, cars, etc. They are not the same quality as in the U.S. but they enjoy them.</p>\n<p>The people, very few may be, really believe in the Catholic Church, but because of tradition or they are able to do what they want they are still Catholics. Also some have gone to the other extreme and are atheists or communists, Fascists, etc. The Communists are not on the surface but you know that the influence is there.</p>\n<p>I am glad to hear the kids are doing better in school. I hope they continue to improve.</p>\n<p>The weather down here has really been hot and sticky but has cooled off today.</p>\n<p>Today, yesterday, tomorrow and two more days next weekend are National Holidays. They are called Carnival Days. And are for the purpose of having fun. Something like Mardi Gras in New Orleans. All day long the kids have water fights, etc. and at night they dance, etc. I got hit by a water balloon yesterday and got soaked, but it was all right.</p>\n<p>Today we are having a picnic to get the kids to bring their friends and have a testimony meeting, etc. I hope we get some good contacts out of it.</p>\n<p>Sheryl is making a scrapbook for me so I am sending her most of the things I am collecting as I go along but I will try and send some to you, too. And you will receive the “Pompero,” the mission magazine. I asked Sheryl if she would like to have you send it to her when you are finished with it but I haven’t received an answer yet.</p>\n<p>Well, I better quit writing for now and mail this letter.

We had about 15 last Friday and half were investigators so I think we can really use the activity for a good use.</p>\n<p>Then Saturday we had a Cena (banquet) supper in regards to the Kilo program, is the welfare plan down here, which really is the way they feed and clothe the construction missionaries. There were around 95 people there and about 10 investigators. They had Ravioli Alleman which are a German Ravioli but I can describe it since eat raviolis all the time and I can’t remember which is which. Soup, salad, and a fruit salad for dessert.

I really have been busy. The day I wrote the last letter, I was told I was changing branches. The next day I packed and got on a bus and traveled south for 19 hours to a resort town on the coast in southern part of the Mission by the name of Necochea. That is where my branch is now. The town is of about 30,000 and its main industry is tourist. The branch is small, around 80 with 90-95 active [percentage?]. My companion is the branch president. His name is William Ward from Huntington, California, just outside of L.A. He is 29 and has 2 months left of his mission. He really is a wonderful guy and has a real testimony of the Gospel.</p>\n<p>Well, I just was getting to know the branch and the tow (about a week later) and one of the Z.C. came down from Mar del Plata to say that he was going to work with my companion for a week and I was to go to Mar del to work with his companion. Well, that is where I am now. We work her Wed, Thurs, &amp; Friday. Friday night we took off to visit the branches and see how everything was going. We went to Tandil, Azul &amp; Olavarria which are Northwest of Mar del Plata. They are about the same size branches as Necochea except Tandil, which is larger. Also in the south there are branches at Tres Arroyos and Bahia Blanca. We are on the bus for around 12 hrs in all and stay one night at Olavarria and one at Tandil.</p>\n<p>The people down here are different than those in the north. I can’t explain the difference but there is one. The people are generally richer here than in the north and because of the tourist trade are more modern. For example: in the north hardly anyone has running hot water in every tap but here it is common and there are more cars here than in the north.</p>\n<p>I saw my first mountains while I was traveling the Z.C. over by Tandil. They remind me of some of those in Nevada, except the whole land is wetter.</p>\n<p>Mar del Plata is a town of around 125,000 now but a month ago there was supposed to have been over a 1,000,000, but now it is fall and they have all left. Hotels, homes, businesses all have closed down with the change in weather.</p>\n<p>I finally finished the roll of film I had in the camera and when I get some money I will send it home to be developed. It is a 36 picture roll and Kodak. They don’t develop States film down here.</p>\n<p>The missionary work is coming along fine. They were supposed to have baptized a man in Necochea this week and there were baptisms in two or three of the other branches in the south.</p>\n<p>I sometimes wonder if I am doing something wrong or if I ust haven’t had the opportunity with baptisms yet because one of the Elders that came down with me has had six already and that means 12 between him and his companion.</p>\n<p>I guess it is not for me to say but for the Lord to decide who is ready and who is not.</p>\n<p>I haven’t received any mail in quite a while because of the move and now me being up here and my mail in Necochea so how is everybody? I hope that the kids are coming along and improving in school. I finally received a letter from Ilene &amp; Terry but they are really busy, I guess.</p>\n<p>We heard part of Conference tonight in Spanish but the power went off before it was over so we didn’t hear much.

Last Saturday we had three baptisms. Two sisters of the girl we baptized a week ago and Jose Kristinusgo (?), the boy I mentioned before.</p>\n<p>The two sisters of Mista were really happy, almost more than Mista was. Before the service we had a testimony meeting and Mista bore her testimony. I about felt like crying when she bore it, I was so happy. She has a strong, sweet testimony and it has grown so much in the last little while. I felt so very happy in knowing I helped her to gain it.</p>\n<p>I had the privilege of baptizing her two sisters, Delia and Anaé. The water was like ice water and the surf was really strong with wind, bit waves and sand, but they both had the faith and I will always remember them. Their Mother and maybe their sister and two younger brothers will be baptized this following Sunday. I really have come to love this family. They remind me a lot of our family because they are a large family and have the lovely relationship that we have.\nSunday was the Conference of the Rama and now there is a local Branch President here which is a lot better and a step forward for the branch. Now we can spend the whole time looking and teaching those that have interest in learning the truth.\nIt has been quite cold here lately, about 30° F and lower. And without my sweater, I really would be cold. I also have bought a wool bufanda or scarf and Pierre hat to help me keep warm.</p>\n<p>Monday we moved out of the Rama. We have been looking for an apartment for quite a long time and couldn’t find one in the center of town so finally [found one] in the plaza. It is really a nice apartment, overlooking a big park and a block from the ocean. It costs a little bit more than the apartment in the branch ($5.500) en vez de $5.000, but it is better all around. The branch needs the space for classes and we didn’t really have any privacy in the branch. That $5.500 a month between us is about $37.50 at the present rate of exchange. I received the check for July yesterday and the exchange was 147 pesos/$1 which is higher than it has ever been since I have been here.</p>\n<p>The work is so very wonderful and I feel so much more enthused since we have had some baptisms.</p>\n<p>How are things coming along? How did your singing go at the fair [New York World’s Fair], Mother? Was the fair exciting?</p>\n<p>Tommy sounds like he is being a real good worker.

I have been in bed, sick with congested tubes to my ears, inflamed throat with pus and everything. I felt it coming but couldn’t do anything to stop it so I ended up in bed. I had to spend about $6-7 for medicines, antibiotics, dristan, shots, etc.</p>\n<p>I feel much better now but I don’t know. I still feel pretty weak. I guess I better take better care of myself. Yesterday, since we couldn’t go to church, all the members missed us and about 15 or 16 came and visited us in the afternoon.</p>\n<p>How are things coming these days at home? Are all the kids well and active? I bet it really is nice there in the hot sun.</p>\n<p>Here it is cold, humid, but no snow. I think if I saw snow I would feel warm. I guess it is that I just never have been completely warm in so long, I can’t remember how it feels.\nMy study of the scriptures goes up and down. I don’t know why, but I read and even though the scriptures are so very wonderful, I guess my heart isn’t in it at that moment and they don’t mean anything to me. Then other times I come across one that really hits me to my toes and then I read and search with a determination that I have never known I had.</p>\n<p>With the help of the Lord, these last six months I have really found am finding more out every day of what I really am. How weak and made up of emotions, worries, and fears.</p>\n<p>When I know that I am doing the Lord’s work and have something to show for my efforts, everything goes a long smoothly. But when I am working hard but not with organization and surety that it is the right thing to be doing I feel insecure, mixed up; I don’t feel like I am accomplishing anything; I worry about everything – people, branch, money, Sheryl, companion, just everything. Things that I know I shouldn’t even be better with.</p>\n<p>I know the Lord really is leading His work here on the earth. All the Elders here that are in leadership positions and such all have problems and all are different, but they are doing the jobs that they have been assigned.</p>\n<p>This is another thing that is making me think. We have been told that Argentina is moving up, that now is the time. Well, the Lord much know this too, because the number of missionaries is increasing rapidly and before the end of the year there will be 180 missionaries in the mission. When I came, there were about 135-140. And right now there are only 15 missionaries above me or with more seniority that are now senior companions. Also, Elder Heath, who is 2nd Counselor in the mission told us that more and more companions are going to be made seniors at 7 &amp; 8 months and then to me he said, he didn’t want to say when, but I should be thinking about it. [Gary had been there just over six months, at this point.]</p>\n<p>I really don’t know if I am ready or not, as a senior, but I know I have the ability so I better prepare even more because I am here to serve the Lord.</p>\n<p>Tell the kids to study hard even during the summer.

I am glad to know that the kids are using their time to learn more because they will really need the things they learn in the future.</p>\n<p>They should be so thankful that they have an organized school system. Down here there are organized schools, but they are Catholic and they don’t include everything. The kids look for classes they can take in certain subjects and when a class is offered that they want, they just grab it.</p>\n<p>The swimming really does sound refreshing to me, even weather that is warm enough to swim. I am not completely well yet. I don’t feel up to par and Saturday my companion came down with the same bug I had but he had a talk yesterday and got up to give it so I don’t know. I am in bed, writing so won’t bother him.</p>\n<p>Wednesday we got an announcement that there was a special missionary conference in Bahia Blanca so Thursday we went to Bahia Blanca for a Zonal missionary conference with President Strong and Elder Heath, the first counselor in the mission. The theme was why aren’t we getting the baptisms we are supposed to be getting. For about 3 ½ hrs we gave ourselves a personal analysis and evaluation. And then President Strong tore us apart. First the Argentine Mission is the lowest in baptisms in S.A. [South America] but it has been prophesized to be the best. All the other missions with the same amount of missionaries are getting as many as 200 more baptisms a month and in the Church, during the first five months of ’64, when we got less than 400 baptisms, some of the missions got around 4,000. Why? Well that was the question. And the answer – well, I don’t know. We did decide that part of it was that we have not been strong enough in our decision and have not challenged our contacts enough, have been lazy, not dedicated as much as we could have been. I know that I haven’t been as dedicated as I should have. At times I should have been studying or thinking of ways to help certain members or investigators. I have talked about things at home, about the weather, Sheryl, lots of things that really are not bad, but are not good either.</p>\n<p>President Strong said that since President McKay has said that every missionary should baptize one person a month at least, that a missionary shouldn’t ever feel like a missionary if he doesn’t do that. Well, in the six months I have been down here, I have had part in 10 baptisms but there were three months when there wasn’t any at all, so I guess that I was really down in the dumps for so long.</p>\n<p>I hope in the future I can improve my effectiveness as a missionary (???) that the Lord’s work can progress even more rapidly here in Argentina.</p>\n<p>Something I have learned since I have been on my mission is the importance of inviting friends and associates to the activities and meetings of the Church. I remember when the missionaries asked me about my friends and I told them that they weren’t interested; well, I guess really the situation was that I wasn’t interested in inviting them, that I was scared. The members tell us the same answers I used to tell the missionaries and we find an answer or a solution for every problem because now I have a testimony of the importance of group meetings in the homes of the members.</p>\n<p>You can’t wait till the people come to you. You have to choose which ones you want at your group meeting and then figure out the way to prepare them to accept the challenge to become a member of the Church. This, too, is a commandment of God. First he said, “Every member a missionary” and then he told us how he said, yes, we have to have sports activities, public relations, English classes, etc. but the most effective way is that the members have group meetings in their homes with some of their friends.</p>\n<p>I really hope and pray that while I am here that you can do your part there in Washington by inviting your friends, associates, etc. to a group meeting.</p>\n<p>About money, I would like to say that I don’t need any more than the usual, but I (???) would you send an extra $5 or $10 (???) all of it because I will just waste it, I know.</p>\n<p>Give my love to the Ward. I haven’t had time to write anyone lately, maybe today.</p>\n<p>I might mention that Elder Mikesell [elder in the same mission, from his Ward in DC] and his companion had 7 baptisms a week ago, which really makes me feel happy and I know increased his testimony.</p>\n<p>Love to everyone and think about who you can invite to a home meeting.</p>\n<p>Love always,\nGary</p>\n",date:"13 Jul 1964",year:"1964",sortable:"19640713"}},{node:{__typename:"Pdf",Caption:null,Description:"<p>July 26, 1964</p>\n<p>Dear Folks,</p>\n<p>I got Mother’s wonderful letter during the week. It is sure good to hear what is going on at home and that everything is going so well. I would like to hear more of what goes on in the ward. I guess I have changed my view of things because before I wasn’t interest[ed].</p>\n<p>It was an interesting wonderful full week the past week. The members are really beginning to want to have group meetings or better “home meetings” and this branch is ready to explode wide open.</p>\n<p>We had, as I think I told you, our first home meeting a week ago and at least two of those that attended are going to be baptized next Saturday. We baptized two more of the wonderful Romano family yesterday and the others are progressing rapidly. And then today was the cream of the crop. President Strong came to visit again but this time with President Tuttle. What a wonderful man of God. He has been visiting the branches in the Southern part of the Mission the past couple of days and spoke here this morning. We had an article yesterday, today, and also for tomorrow, a personal interview with someone from the local paper. All with photos.</p>\n<p>There were fifteen investigators there and 3 I have never seen before.</p>\n<p>President Strong &amp; President Tuttle both talked on the same things, repentance, doing your best, home meetings, missionaries for construction.</p>\n<p>I have heard President Tuttle three times since I have been down here and every time he has just hit to the bottom of the problem. He said this is the best branch he has visited this trip which really makes me proud but all the more humble because of the responsibility that we have as missionaries to work with this potential.</p>\n<p>After the meeting we went and ate with them and both him and Pres. Strong are so friendly, talkative and etc. when they are relaxing but so powerful when speaking for their calling. It makes me so much more sure of the responsibility that I have to prepare myself to meet the challenge here and wherever I am sent.</p>\n<p>The Mission as a whole has really been suffering lately for baptisms even though the missionaries and everybody have been working so hard, but lately here and, I know, in the whole mission, things are ready to explode. There is just something in the air; the spirit in the meetings. All add up to an explosion that will blast the Mission wide open and up in baptisms, etc.</p>\n<p>Today I have my first chance to translate in a meeting. Pres. Strong’s youngest son (14) came with him and was asked to speak. I have never been so scared in all my life. I felt like I was going to freeze up but I don’t know why or how but I did it and I guess it was the Spirit of God and not me because everyone told me that I had never spoken better Spanish.\nI hope that you read can read this letter; I am writing pretty fast.</p>\n<p>Tomorrow we are going to Tres Arroyos again for a monthly missionary meeting which is being started here in the South. Which is really good. One of the troubles down here is that sometimes we, as missionaries, feel all alone.</p>\n<p>Give my love to everybody and tell them that the missionary here, there, everywhere in the world is ready to explode but we, as members, have to do the work.</p>\n<p>Well, I will close for now.</p>\n<p>Love always,\nGary</p>\n",date:"26 Jul 1964",year:"1964",sortable:"19640726"}},{node:{__typename:"Pdf",Caption:null,Description:"<p>August 23, 1964</p>\n<p>Dear Folks,</p>\n<p>Another wonderful week has gone by here in the mission home.

Through one of the missionaries and a contact that they had, President Strong, President Stone of the North Mission and President Tuttle and a few missionaries visited President Illia of Argentina (Pres.

There is also another set of Elders and a set of Hermanas (Sisters). From what I have seen so far, the members are really wonderful but a little weak as far as being strong characters and able to stand alone.</p>\n<p>We live in an apartment now. At first we lived in the branch and slept on benches because we didn’t have any beds. The apartment is pretty nice but will be better after it is completely fixed up. There are two bedrooms and a large living/dining room combination with kitchen and bathroom at their sides. The barrio or ward is one of the few I have evern seen that has lawn in front of every house. It really is a beautiful area. We have been tracking and the people are quite receptive to the gospel although the members themselves are quite against inviting their friends out to Church and having Home Meetings.</p>\n<p>By the way, how are the “home meetings” coming at home? Or are they?</p>\n<p>The other elders that live here with us are really good.

The theme of the Conference was “By Your Fruits, You Will Be Known.” It was really good. Some of the ideas that came out of it are excellent in everything.

The thoughts don’t make him a success but with the thoughts definite and organized, he will do the action it takes him to be a success. That the idea of not making a success will for a certainty make a person unsuccessful. For example: a missionary that doesn’t have any confidence in himself will never be a leader unless he changes his attitude.

We have been using a flip-board with pictures over Relief Society, Priesthood &amp; the family and to those who want to know more – a color brochure – (something like Mormon’s Story)and then setting up a date to pick up the color brochure and finding out if they want to know more. Anyway, this lady said that her husband, who is a school teacher of military techniques and mathematics, I think, was interested and couldn’t we come back Saturday morning.

I have an idea so I will mention it anyway I think it would be better if you sent it all to me, including the envelope it came in. My idea is this, about 7 or 8 months ago, one of the Branch Presidents in B.A. [Buenos Aires] asked me if I had a relative that had been in Argentina before on a mission or in the Marines. I told him not that I knew of and asked him why. He said that there was a young girl (14 or 15) who had just come to B.A. from “Salta,” whose name was Matthews and was looking for her relatives. Well, I said I was sorry but I couldn’t help. About a week later the girl came in. I talked to her and she said that her father had just died and so she was looking for her father or his relatives. It sounded to me like her Father was a Marine or sailor and had married her Mother during the war and never came back. Well, anyway, I talked to Pres. Strong and he felt the same way that even though the circumstances were mixed up, she wanted a free ticket to the States. I told her that I was sorry and [even] though our name was the same, that I couldn’t help her, but I gave her my card, which has our home address.</p>\n<p>That is the only thing that I think it could be so I know it would be better if I receive it and just turn it over to the mission.</p>\n<p>How is Lydia coming?

So there wasn’t a bed I could sleep on except the floor. The next day a group of five Elders, called the Quintet Mormon, which is touring the Argentine and Uruguayan Mission, singing and creating a good name and friends for the Chruch.

Since they were guests, we let them sleep in the beds (5 in 4 beds) and the of us (5) slept on the floor.</p>\n<p>Also, in the after, the B.Y.U. basketball team arrived and they were in our hands also.

The apartment in which we were living wasn’t the best and since the contract had run out, the elders had found another apartment. And we started moving into it. The construction supervisor let us use his truck to do the hauling, but it took longer than we thought.

Things are real fine here in Olavarria but I am not organized yet.</p>\n<p>It is really an experience to be Pte. [President] of a branch. The branch here is small (61) members and the town is very, very hard. The Church has been here around 4 or 5 years and hasn’t progressed very much at all during my mission. The people are wonderful – like I mentioned before. I love the south more than any other part of Argentina. When I was down south before, the whole south was in one district. In order that each group of branches could grow faster, the mission split the south into three districts. Our district here is probably the smallest and the one that has the furthest to go. It has three branches, Azul, Olavarria y Tandil. The district president and two of the branch pres. are missionaries. Also there is very little priesthood, especially Melchizedek, and only around 210 members in the whole district.</p>\n<p>My companion is David Sharp from ?? What I mean is that he isn’t sure, either. He left for his mission from Salt Lake, from his grandmother’s house. His Father is an Army career man and right now is in Texas and hoping not to go to Viet Nam. His Mother is in Seattle and before they have lived about everywhere, Baltimore, Germany, Okinawa, Japan, etc. He has been down about eight months and really is a fine elder.</p>\n<p>I really like it here in Olavarria as I mentioned. It is a town of around 60 thousand, mostly farming with a little industry but really out in the country. Yesterday we went out again and visited one of the few complete member families.

The last 2 miles is on a dirt road and I didn’t know but they still don’t have electricity. They care for about 60-70 head of cattle, 100 sheep, chickens, dogs (10-15), cats, geese, ducks, and every other type of animal you can think of, but they are really happy together out there and they have two of the cutest kids you will ever see.</p>\n<p>Elder Tasman Johnson is the br.

I can also see more and more the responsibility of a bishop. I don’t know what I am doing but the Lord is sure blessing me here in the branch. Last night there was an attendance of 35 which included 5 investigators. That is about 15 more than usually come out. Also, those complying with the law of tithing has increased almost double over the past month.</p>\n<p>Last Monday we had a conference in Tres Aroyos with all the Elders of the south and Pte [President] &amp; Sis.

He is working in Tres Aroyos.\nI am getting to know Olavarria pretty well and I really love here, of course, I have always loved the south and, as you can see by the attendance at church, we are having pretty good success. The thing that is such a testimony to me is that those that were there came on their own and not through any labors of mine.</p>\n<p>Saturday we are going to baptize a lady of 33 that has a stronger testimony than most members. She first heard of the church about ten years ago in the north but was working in a home of a staunch Catholic and couldn’t talk to the missionaries. So ever since then she has been praying for the truth and now she has the chance. She read the Book of Mormon in three days and knew it was true. Already she was complying with everything and really is one of the strongest character persons I have ever taught and is eager to learn; it almost shacks me to feel the Spirit of the Lord working so very much in one person after seeing so many others that don’t even care, but it just proves that the Lord calls those that are ready.</p>\n<p>In one way I feel more relaxed right now than any other time in my mission because I know that I have to make the decision for everything that is done here in the church and I know that if I am faithful, the Lord will help me to make the right ones.</p>\n<p>Mom &amp; Dad, I keep forgetting to repeat how much I love and respect you for what you have done for me in my life and the example that you have given me.</p>\n<p>Say hello to everyone for me and give my love to Ruth.</p>\n<p>Love always,\nGary A.

As usual I feel badly, but I just don’t organize my time enough.</p>\n<p>Things are wonderful here. Two weeks ago, when we went to District Conference, there were 27 that went from our branch, which is real good, I think, considering there are 66 members.</p>\n<p>As far as finding people to teach, we aren’t having much luck, though I know that there are people here that want to know the truth. We are teaching or trying to teach three families that came looking for the gospel themselves and they do look pretty good.</p>\n<p>Last Sunday I had to go to a special branch president conference in Mar Del Plata. Although it is in another district, it is the place most central and convenient whenever they have a tri-district activity.</p>\n<p>The meeting was to organize the Home Teaching Program here in the south. It was a real good meeting and everyone seemed to have a good spirit to work hard with the program in their respective branches. The meeting was held in the new chapel which was just finished (this makes 6 in the mission) and it is really beautiful. I think that I mentioned it before when I was in Necochea, but Mar Del Plata is one of the most beautiful cities I have ever been in and the new chapel fits in wonderfully.</p>\n<p>The branch presidency was there from Necochea and it was wonderful to see all the members from Necochea and from Mar Del and the other branches.</p>\n<p>Here in Olavarria the branch is going fine but as usual, there are quite a few problems that keep me pulling my hair out and also close to the Lord. The branch has had a problem for about three years between two factions of pride and during this period things have gotten better and then later worse. I have to watch very carefully, sometimes, in what I say or do so as to not make one or the other turn against me or show I think more of one group or the other. It is something that you wouldn’t expect to see in the Church but along with the jealous whispering and gossip I know it is there in the whole world.</p>\n<p>Monday we had our missionary meeting in Tandil and did a little sightseeing afterwards. Tandil is located next to the beginning of Argentina’s mid-mountain range. It is really a beautiful city but has a huge replica of Christ on the cross and images of Christ in different points before his crucifixion all located in this path leading up a hill with the cross at the top. I have never seen so much imagination and falsehood in my life. Most of the images of the life of Christ aren’t located in the Bible and just came out of someone’s mind.\nAlso in Tandil there is a replica of a castle used to fight against the Indians by the Danish families that settled Tandil first – all very beautiful.</p>\n<p>Well, I am running out of ideas but I do want to say I love you all and I feel very blessed to be part of the family and I hope that I never do anything that will be a disappointment to anyone.</p>\n<p>May God bless all of you.</p>\n<p>Love,\nGary</p>\n",date:"08 Sep 1965",year:"1965",sortable:"19650908"}},{node:{__typename:"Pdf",Caption:null,Description:"<p>15 de Septiembre, 1965</p>\n<p>Dear Folks,</p>\n<p>I have been awfully busy and I am really happy now I have a few minutes to write and tell you everything that is happening.\nI can’t remember if I told Lorin and Susan “Happy Birthday from your big brother.” So I will say it now. Also, Dennis, “Happy Birthday, the 27th.”</p>\n<p>Things here are progressing but a lot slower than I think they should sometimes, especially in the proselyting work. I feel sometimes that we are wasting the Lord’s time when we are tracting but I know that we will find somebody waiting for us, eventually.</p>\n<p>Monday we had the missionary meeting here in Olavarria for the first time since I have been here and we went and played a little basketball afterwards – it felt good although it has been around 4 months since the last time I played.</p>\n<p>Thursday 15</p>\n<p>Well, I got called away and never got back to finishing the letter, but in the time elapse I received your letter of the 9th so I will try to write a little in answer to it also.</p>\n<p>What is this data sheet that Daddy is making going to be used for?</p>\n<p>Tommy, I am proud of you for baptizing Susan.</p>\n<p>Susan, How lucky you are to be baptized in the Church of God, to have the guidance of his hand in your life. I hope and pray that we might all.</p>\n<p>Last night we went out to visit the Rodriquez family. I am sure I have mentioned them before but anyway, they live out of town 7 KM (about 4+ miles) on a farm. They take care of the land for a corporation. Anyway, they don’t have any electricity and modern utensils of a farm of today and except for his truck and their portable radio, you can see the life of a 100 – 150 years ago here in Argentina in the campo. He dresses almost like the photos you see of gouchos and some of the worker do dress that way. The life is hard but refreshing. Their two kids play with the chickens, ducks, geese, lambs, dogs, cats, and horses just like I did with the neighborhood kids.</p>\n<p>The family gets up and goes to bed with the sun and really are just part of nature. Still they have strong testimonies of the gospel and do all that is possible to be completely active. It makes me think about our forefathers crossing the plains and settling the west and I am sure it is somewhat the same.</p>\n<p>Well, I have to go so I will say once again but not enough that I love you all so very much and hope the Lord guides us all ------- Gary.</p>\n",date:"15 Sep 1965",year:"1965",sortable:"19650915"}},{node:{__typename:"Pdf",Caption:null,Description:"<p>24 de septembre, 1965</p>\n<p>Dear Folks,</p>\n<p>Well, your letter of the 19th came in this morning so I thought I better sit down and write you.

We have met a few families that we are teaching, which help’s my spirit a lot. I sure hope we can find the way to challenge a few of them for baptism.\nThis program of BM for Christmas really sounds fantastic. I only wish that we could get out a few more down here. It really is the way to open a person’s desire to know the truth.</p>\n<p>Also the new 6 lessons to give all new members is probably like our integration lessons but better because it isn’t up to the missionaries.</p>\n<p>I really never realized how important missionaries are in the lives of the members down here.

Elder Sharp was made a senior, which makes me happy to see him progress. Anyway my new companion is Elder John Dewey from Brewerton, Washington. He has been down now a little over two months and was on a “work mission” 9 months before his call to come to Argentina. In fact, he left from Salt Lake on his proselyting mission.</p>\n<p>Things here are really wonderful and the Lord is blessing me so much.</p>\n<p>Last night we talked with a group of people that you meet few of in your mission. I had talked to them once before but not to the extent we did last night.</p>\n<p>We came in contact a few weeks ago tracting. We were tracting at night and a man came to the door and said that they were busy but would like to talk to us. I thought he looked German but I wasn’t too sure and it was a large, somewhat modern house. We went back and they were all waiting for us. Him his wife and 15-year-old daughter. And also a friend of the family. They mentioned that they were Catholic but were interested to know what the “Mormons” believed in. We found that he is the owner of a construction firm that is building most of the large apartment buildings here in Olavarria and that the friend was from B.A. (the capital). Well, we talked to them about two hours and the friend had most of the questions and answers. He seemed like a person well-read and intelligent.</p>\n<p>Last night he mentioned that he had made a study of all the major religions of the world, including Mormonism. He said he believed in Jesus Christ and took the best out of [them all] to build up his belief in God. He said he had read the Book of Mormon a few years ago, along with the Bible, Koran, etc. and I challenged him to read it again. I feel so lost for words when I talk to a person like that. I know all I can do is bear my testimony, but I want so much to show him what’s right but he has to say yes or no.</p>\n<p>It is sure a testimony builder to me to see how much more I have than the rest of the world and I wish I could do so much more for people like that.</p>\n<p>As time goes by, even though I don’t was to, I have to think of the future.

The Spirit of the Lord has really been with us the last few weeks and it really makes you feel blessed to feel His influence.\nWe have been doing a lot of tracting and to really look into the lives of people is really a testimony to anyone of the truth of the gospel.</p>\n<p>The problems of the branch are still here that have been here for years. The jealousy and the pride and the gossip that can kill anybody. Although they are still here, I have decided to leave them and not interfere but to do more of what I am really called for – that is to challenge and baptize and to find those that the Lord is preparing for His church.</p>\n<p>We have also been working, looking for a hall to hold conference in. That is district conference in December. I think we have found on and I really feel blessed because everybody told us there weren’t any. I was thinking the other day, when we walked out of the office of the president of a club, that what a difference of the Gary I knew a few years ago. The idea of talking to business leaders, etc. would have frightened me to death but now I do it without thinking because it is part of my calling to serve the Lord and that is the most important thing of my life.</p>\n<p>I just thought again of some of the people that we meet tracting. And it makes me really see the power that the devil has over people to warp their way of thinking and to rationalize their way of thinking and living to feel that it is the only way and that they will arrive back in God’s presence through his grace.</p>\n<p>Mom, I am really proud of you for the effort you are putting forth to help others see the truth.</p>\n<p>Dennis mentioned that there are eight missionaries out from our ward now.

The way they have it is to travel through the Indian ruins in Bolivia and Peru, including Machu Pichu, arriving in Lima on Saturday the 22nd. I am not sure of the plane schedules but I am sure I could probably get a plane from there and arrive in Washington late Saturday night.

If I went with the rest of the Elders up through Bolivia and Peru, I would arrive home, probably on Sunday morning, at the earliest; that is Sunday the23. And since orientation at the Y starts on Friday the 28th, I would have to leave at least by Wednesday to make it in time, leaving only two or three days at home.</p>\n<p>I don’t think that is enough time for the family or for me.

I have to pay rent until the day I leave and most of the other expenses will be the same.

Records, ???, etc, but since the weight situation is like it is, it can’t be too much.</p>\n<p>Things here are wonderful, I feel happier and finer than I have for a long time. Maybe it is that I am working harder and maybe it is because there is more to do and I just work hard and don’t worry about it.

Smith and Bishop Sabin.</p>\n<p>My companion mentioned something today that was interesting. As I mentioned before, Apostle Kimball has set a figure of 50,000 baptisms next year in South America and my companion said he can see the hand of the Lord in this because for the first year the Church has translated 75% of the programs before the year has begun and our mission, for the first time wouldn’t have to substitute other manuals or programs because of lack of new materials. Also the number of missionaries has doubled in the last year, so really now is the time. The leaders are ready for more members; the branches are ready; the missionaries are here and wanting to serve the Lord and the people are ready to listen so really there is nothing stopping the progress in S.A.
