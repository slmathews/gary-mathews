<p>Dear Folks,</p>
<p>I don’t know why you didn’t get my letter but I wrote you from Denver on the 2nd.</p>
<p>But since it doesn’t sound like it, I stayed in Denver until last night. It was the most wonderful nine days that I can remember. It shows me how much more I love Sheryl than I thought. Sheryl only had to work two of the nights I was there.</p>
<p>The night I got there we went to the Drive in and saw “Spencer’s Mt.” &amp; “PT 109.”</p>
<p>Wednesday we went to the Natural History Museum and that night went to MIA.</p>
<p>Thursday I helped her clean house and then we went swimming. That night we watched TV. Friday we drove around Denver and that night we did the grocery shopping and made fudge.</p>
<p>Saturday we went with her brother and parents to the Air Force Academy &amp; the big Zoo in Colorado Springs. That night we saw “Hootenanny Hoot” and it happened at the World’s Fair at the Drive In. Sunday we watched Conference on TV and took a drive.</p>
<p>Monday we waxed her car and talked and went and saw “Cleopatra” at night.</p>
<p>Tuesday we talked and she had to work at night.</p>
<p>Wednesday Sheryl slept most of the day and I studied my scriptures. That night was MIA and then she had to go to work.</p>
<p>Thursday, while Sheryl slept, I washed, ironed and packed.</p>
<p>Thursday night we went to Denver at the &quot;Golden Ox,” a high class beef house and had steak and then I left there at night.</p>
<p>All in all I have never been so happy in my life. And Daddy, I only spent $2 the whole time.</p>
<p>I was glad to get your letter. I don’t know my address in Provo yet and the one at the Mission home is 119 North Main, Salt Lake City, Utah.</p>
<p>Give all my love to the kids.</p>
<p>I don’t think I will need any money before November but if I do I will write and tell you.</p>
<p>Love always,
Gary</p>

<p>Dear Folks,</p>
<p>Well almost two days of my week in the mission home is up and I love it. I came in Sunday night after seeing Ilene in the afternoon. I didn’t see Grandmother or Grandpa or Stan or LaRae because they had gone down to Summit Thursday night. I will see them next Sunday I guess.</p>
<p>Besides Wayne [Mikesell – from his home ward] &amp; I, there are four others going to Argentina. Others from back there in the ??? are Mike, Alan Barlow (the kid I worked with at the farm), James Ricks from Falls Church, and two kids from Baltimore. I also know about 10 kids from Ricks.</p>
<p>There are 253 going through this week (one was killed in an auto accident on the way) and 8 of them are sisters. 17 different General Authorities : we have already heard from President Joseph F. Smith, LaGrande Richards, Gordon B. Hinckley, S. Dilworth Young, &amp; Richard L. Evans, also a Dr. Richards on foot care.</p>
<p>The Home is really an experience and I know it will be helpful through my mission.</p>
<p>It looks like now I might need some money before November but I won’t know until I get to the Y. We will take 9 hrs of Spanish and an hr. of P.E. at the Y. Plus studies at night so they are really pouring it on.</p>
<p>Give all my love to the family.</p>
<p>Love always
Gary</p>
<p>October 16, 1963</p>
<p>I didn’t get the letter mailed so will write some more. I received your letter today and was glad to hear everything is all right. I received my certificate of clergy today and was set apart by LeGrande Richards. He gave me a wonderful blessing. I hope I can live worthy to receive it.</p>
<p>I talked to the Hickenloopers this afternoon and will see them Saturday. After buying my garments and other things I needed I only have $70 left but I still don’t know how much more I will need.</p>
<p>It is getting late so goodbye for now.</p>
<p>Love again
Gary</p>

<p>Dear Folks,</p>
<p>I don’t know exactly what I told you last letter so I will just write.</p>
<p>The week in the Mission home was very, very uplifting. The week was very hard, both physically and a strain on the mind but it was worth. We heard from 13 General Authorities and quite a few more on the Missionary Committee.</p>
<p>I was set apart by Elder LeGrande Richards on Wednesday afternoon. He gave me a very wonderful blessing. I only hope that I am worthy of it.</p>
<p>I shook President McKay’s hand later in the afternoon and that, too, is something I will remember for a long time. The brightness and the spirit that glows from him proves beyond any doubt that he is a prophet of God.</p>
<p>I think that Wednesday afternoon and Friday &amp; Saturday mornings were the highlights of the week. Of course Friday &amp; Saturday was when we went through the temple. It has left an impression on me I will never forget.</p>
<p>Grandmother and Grandfather and Aunt LaRae &amp; Uncle Stan came down Sunday and went to the Testimonial with me. I went over to Hickenloopers on Saturday.</p>
<p>Now I am in Provo. We have to start speaking Spanish out of our rooms on Wednesday or pay a fine.</p>
<p>I have to go to class now.</p>
<p>Love always,
Gary</p>

<p>Dear Folks,</p>
<p>I was glad to receive your letter yesterday. It was a pleasure to learn that everything is all right except for colds.</p>
<p>Everything here is all right except that the school really pours it on. As I mentioned, we were supposed to speak only Spanish out of our room the third day we were here. Well, we try our best. I have the same roommate (&amp; companion) I had in the Mission home plus two more. My companion is from San Diego. The other two are form Pocatello and L.A.</p>
<p>We are in the San Fernando District of Zone II of the Language Training Mission. Zone II is those Spanish Missionaries going to Missions south of the Canal. The Spanish is pretty difficult. They say that you cover as much in the first week and a half that you do in two years of High School Spanish.
Our schedule is: up around 6:00; District meeting, 6:30; Breakfast/Zone Meeting, 7:45; Class, 8:00 -10:00; Language Lab, 10 -11; Class 11 -12; Lunch, 12 -1; Class, 1 – 4; Dinner, 4:30 -5; Gym, 5-6; study with members of District, 6-7:30; Language Lab, 7:30 – 8:30; study, 8:30-10:00; bed by 10:30. It is really a lot of fun and an experience worth Remembering even though it is hard.</p>
<p>On the money. Nobody has given me any money yet so I only have enough for the first month. We have to pay for health insurances &amp; etc. besides the $2.5 for board &amp; room. So that is the extra fees. I will write and tell you how much more I need.</p>
<p>Terry cut his finger the first week but I don’t know how bad. I guess Ilene will tell you.</p>
<p>Well, I have tests in the morning in Oral, Dictation, Pronunciation, Writing, and Memorization so I better close. All the grades, except pronunciation are put on file at the Y and they are our grades. We have tests once a week.</p>
<p>Love always,
Gary</p>

<p>Dear Folks,</p>
<p>It was good to received your letter and learn all the news from home. I will try writing some Spanish.</p>
<p>Here it is Sunday and I have been here two weeks. It seems like only yesterday I came to Provo and a couple of days since I entered the Mission Home. Though when I think of all the things that have happened, it seems like a lifetime.</p>
<p>In the two weeks I have been here, we have covered 100 pages of our book. And passed almost everything I remember taking in high school. I’m doing pretty well, even though I want to do better. The first week I got an A in memorization; A- in Oral; A- in written; B+ in Dictation; and a D+ in Pronunciation. The Pronunciation grade is in comparison with a native. This week I got A- in Memorization; B+ in Oral; B- in Dictation; C+ in Written and D- in Pronunciation. I went down this week but I know I can do better.</p>
<p>The Spirit that dwells here is just tremendous. Our district has some problems with different pairs of companions and we prayed about it and then held a testimony meeting. There was no problem after that. And the spirit of the district increased so very much.</p>
<p>Hola mi madre y my padre.  ¿Qué haren mis hermanos y mis hermanas? ¿Cómo está en sus lecciones? ¿Cómo están los missioneros?</p>
<p>[Hello, Mother &amp; Dad. How are my brothers and sisters? How are you doing in your studies? How are the missionaries?]</p>
<p>Well, I have to close now so Goodbye.</p>
<p>Love always,
Gary</p>

<p>Dear Folks,</p>
<p>It was good to hear from you again. I’m glad everything is all right at home. Thank the girls for the pictures. I really enjoy seeing how they are improving in their art work.
I am glad to hear the girls are maturing. I expect them to be all grown up little ladies when I get home.</p>
<p>I hope the boys are maturing just as much and are keeping up in their school work.</p>
<p>Tommy, how is the basketball coming? Have you won anymore games?</p>
<p>Lorin &amp; Dennis, how is your Scouting coming? You doing anything?</p>
<p>Things here are just great. It doesn’t seem possible that I have been here three weeks, but I have.</p>
<p>We have covered 170 pages now. I have a 3.35 average in the four grades that they keep record of at the Y. I hope I can keep it up.</p>
<p>I don’t know what I told you on money and will tell you the whole story. It costs us $2.63 a day and that comes to $220 for the six weeks. I have paid $85, so I have $135 left to pay. Nobody has given me any money yet. I think they are waiting till I leave for Argentina. Because of other expenses (clothes, books, etc.) I better have $150. You don’t need to send very much now but I only have $3 to my name right now and I haven’t spent any for almost a week.</p>
<p>I don’t know what our schedule will be when we leave but a group that is leaving next week has a 13 hr stopover in New York.</p>
<p>I have some more letters to write and I can’t think of anything else to say so I will close for now.</p>
<p>Love always,
Your son
Gary</p>

<p>Dear Folks,</p>
<p>Thank you for your letters. I really feel good when I get a letter, especially one form home.</p>
<p>I am glad that the kids are maturing more every day. I am just sorry I can’t be there to see them do it</p>
<p>Thank you for sending the money. I was wondering what I was going to do. I will be sure and spend it wisely.</p>
<p>I am glad Tommy is enjoying his Church activities. They will mean a lot to him later in life.</p>
<p>Here everything is about the same. Elders leave every week and new ones come in. It doesn’t seem possible that I have been 4 weeks – one third of my time, but I have.</p>
<p>The Spirit seems to increase more every day, hour, and second. I feel closer to God more every day.</p>
<p>I am learning to think more in Spanish every day. I can pray &amp; bear my testimony almost completely in Spanish now when only a week ago I couldn’t do anything but the basic parts of the prayer in Spanish.</p>
<p>We have covered over 200 pages now in the book and started on the plan in a week &amp; a half. I am keeping up my grades even though I fear I am not learning all I should. I have a 3.22 average for the four weeks in the part they turn in to the Y and have raised my pronunciation for a D- to a C- which is pretty good. It is based on how native you sound.</p>
<p>As I told you when I was in Denver, I found what my true feelings were for Sheryl. And she found hers. Since then we have written each other once a week and I sent her a book for her birthday. Last weekend her family visited her sister who lives in Salt Lake. Saturday Sheryl came down to try to see Ilene, but they missed connections. Anyway it really felt good to know we could control ourselves enough to be in the same town and not try to see each other.</p>
<p>I hope that during the next two years we can keep up the love and Spirit that we have.</p>
<p>At Thanksgiving we have been told we will stay here in the dorm. I feel a little sorry but then I guess it is best to keep away from other types of life as much as we can.</p>
<p>They are preparing a big banquet for us so we wouldn’t miss out on the food.</p>
<p>Well, I better get back to my studies.</p>
<p>Love, Gary</p>
<p>P.S. The letters both got here the same day.</p>

<p>Dear Folks</p>
<p>I was glad to get your letters. I am happy to know the kids are doing better in school and I hope Tommy does better next time. I I would write a letter to all of you but I don’t have enough time so I will have to let this one do.</p>
<p>It doesn’t seem possible that another complete week has gone by and I only have 7 more to go.</p>
<p>We start on the plan Wednesday and take 2 pages a day plus one Spanish scripture from then on. I didn’t do as well this week in my tests but it was my own fault and I will work harder. I still have a solid B average and I hope I can keep it up.</p>
<p>The Spirit here increases more every day and I just love. We have Testimony Meetings that build the Spirit up more in the District.
Is anyone going to try to get up to see in New York, if I get a layover? The group that leaves tomorrow has a 15 hour layover in New York but I can’t tell you if I will or not because some don’t even go to N.Y.</p>
<p>I have to study some more so Goodbye for now.</p>

<p>Dear Folks</p>
<p>I got Daddy’s letter yesterday. It was good to hear from home.</p>
<p>It was really sad about President Kennedy. We watched the funeral on T.V. Monday and it was sure sad.</p>
<p>We started on the plan this week. We have finished the first six conclusions in three days. We do a page in the morning and one in the afternoon.</p>
<p>On Thanksgiving Gerald had Grandfather and Grandmother, Ilene &amp; Terry and some more. They invited me but they told us not to visit relatives. And they prepared a banquet for us anyway.</p>
<p>Today we (our district) went to see a holiday double feature on campus (Polly Anna &amp; . . . ) Ilene and Terry came in and sat down behind us so I learned all of the latest news that she knew. They seem to be doing fine.</p>
<p>I saw Brother Fitzgerald yesterday in the bookstore and he said to say hello to you.</p>
<p>I was wondering if someone could make me some cookies and send them to me. Most of the other Elders in the district have gotten things from home and it is y turn We get quite tired of just eating cafeteria food and it helps to get something from home.</p>
<p>I have a couple of more letters to write so I will close for now.</p>

<p>Dear Folks,</p>
<p>I received your letter today and I am glad you got to see Uncle LaVar. It probably did the kids good to see him.
How are the boys doing in Scouting? All you said was they had a Court of Honor!</p>
<p>I have found I will need some more money than what I told you. The fifty dollars you sent me along with some that both grandparents have sent me is already gone. I paid some more on my housing. I owe between $55 and $80 more depending on what day we leave here in January and bought another dectalon [I think this is a version of polyester manufactured then, but couldn’t find anything on Google] shirt. Right now I am washing my clothes and I don’t have a ¢ left. So I need some right away.
We started and finished the 1st discussion of the plan the past week. It really is a challenge. Also the scripture classes are really tough but they are coming.</p>
<p>I received a letter from both Grandmothers the past week and they seem to be doing well.</p>
<p>We have been told we can call home for Christmas if we want and was wondering if I did what would be the best time?</p>
<p>Well, I better study (I had to give a talk Monday morning in Spanish and I haven’t started.)</p>
<p>Love always,
Gary</p>
<p>P.S. Remember the money.</p>

<p>Dear Folks,</p>
<p>I was glad to receive your letters the past week and thank you for sending the check. I sure needed it.</p>
<p>On when I leave, I don’t definitely know what day, but our 12 weeks are up the 10th of January so it should probably by 12, 13, 14 or 15 of January on the day.</p>
<p>On how much more money I will need, I don’t really know. I wouldn’t need any more till just before I leave but I haven’t decided what I need to buy or how much more I will need to pay on account. I think it should be about $30 more on rent and I think I better buy a good pair of walking shoes because it doesn’t sound like they have good ones in Argentina. And maybe another white shirt. I have now 2 s.s. [short sleeve] Dectoleues, 2 L.S. [long sleeve] Dectolenes, 2 s.s. Dectron and 2 W &amp; W [wash &amp; wear?] long sleeve that I am planning on taking with me so I don’t know.</p>
<p>I bought some Christmas presents and I am sending them off tomorrow. I didn’t buy Ruth anything so I wondered if you would for me?</p>
<p>Speaking of Ruth, how is she doing? And give her my love.</p>
<p>Well, I have some scriptures to memorize so I better get back to my studies.</p>

<p>Dear Folks,</p>
<p>I received your letter today. Thank you for the money. Yes, I think that it will do me until I get to Argentina.</p>
<p>It doesn’t seem that I will be leaving in less than a week, but I am. Of the Spanish that I am supposed to know, I guess I won’t know really until I get a chance to really use it. Of the plan, I know the first three really well and am hazy on the fourth and a little better on the fifth and we haven’t finished the sixth yet. I think I will get at least the first five down good when I leave.</p>
<p>On my income tax, I will try to remember to sign a form and send it home, but just in case, if you do get up to New York, bring one up. On my tithing, I don’t think I paid up in school but I will check and write a letter. You maybe ought to write Ricks College, if it doesn’t come very soon. And maybe call Briggs Construction.</p>
<p>On the money, I am supposed to have $150 to get into Argentina and I only will have $100 after I pay my few odds and ends off so send some as fast as you can.</p>
<p>Well, it is time for class so I better close so I can get it off.</p>

Gary</p>

<p>Dear Folks,</p>
<p>Well, I arrived in Buenos Aires all right. The trip was a little bit rough at the end and I got a little bit sick. They have moved the Mission Home into the new building and it is really nice.</p>
<p>We arrived at Buenos Aires about 3:00 in the afternoon. President Strong met us and took us to the Mission Home. We were shown around and filled out some papers and were given instructions. Friday morning we were given more instructions and then went downtown to change our money to pesos. Right after lunch we were given our assignments and met our companions and took off. My companion is Elder George Wilbar of Castle Dale, Utah. I am his first junior so we will have to learn together. We are stationed at San Nicolas, a little farming town north of Buenos Aires. It took us five and a half hours to get here by bus. We arrived late last night and met the President of the Rama or branch and the two other Elders who are working here in San Nicolas. They are building a chapel and we will spend one or two days a week helping build it.</p>
<p>We are staying in a hotel and have to eat out but it is pretty clean and well kept.</p>
<p>When I got down here I found all the mail I didn’t receive at Christmas. I guess people didn’t know how long I would be at the Y.</p>
<p>The Country is really beautiful and the people are quite friendly and wonderful. Buenos Aires was quite modern in some respects and quite primitive in other respects according to American standards.</p>
<p>I have some more letters to write and not really anything to say so I will close for now.</p>
<p>Love always,
Gary</p>

<p>Dear Folks,</p>
<p>I have been meaning to write you but just haven’t sat down and written the letter.  I received the money yesterday and Tommy’s letter also. We received a package from the Mission Home today and your letter was in it.</p>
<p>The weather here is good old humid weather and very hot. It has averaged between 32°C and 37°C every day I have been down here – 89 – 99+. Which is really hot. We have been working an extra hour at night and sleeping an hour during siesta time in the afternoon.</p>
<p>On my understanding Spanish, it is only when most of the words I haven’t heard before that I don’t understand.</p>
<p>San Nicolas is a lot larger than I said. It has between 70, &amp; 80,000 people. It also is a very important port for this part of Argentina.</p>
<p>The work has been awful hard and we haven’t been too successful yet. It is because we are both new, but things are looking better. We have had two or three group meetings with friends of members and a few of the people have let us in when we have been tracting.</p>
<p>On the Construction – we have worked one day each week making block. They don’t have any commercial blocks in Argentina so they all have to be made by each construction firm. It is really hard but interesting work. There are five Argentine labor missionaries and two from the States. One, the supervisor and the other a full-time missionary that was asked to work full-time on construction. Because of the need for Chapels, there are five or six full-time missionaries working on Construction and they are calling all Argentine youths as labor missionaries and none anymore as proselyting missionaries.</p>
<p>The food down here is really good, even if some is a lot different. We are living in a hotel and eat in Restaurants. We pay around $200 pesos a day for food which is about $1.50 and our room costs us $2250 pesos a month which is just under $20 for rent.</p>
<p>The people here are really wonderful and friendly. Their customs are different and they speak a different language but they are the same as those in the states.</p>
<p>Well, I am writing this during siesta time so if the letter is a little wrinkled, you will know why.</p>
<p>I better close and send this off.</p>
<p>Lots of love<br>
Always<br>
Gary</p>

<p>Dear Folks,</p>
<p>I received your letter of the 1st today, so it took a little longer than usual. It was the fifth letter I have gotten since I have been down here – 3 from home, one from Sheryl, and one from Ilene &amp; Terry.</p>
<p>If you want to include more in the letters. Ilene sent 4 pages, regular paper, 2 back &amp; front, and Sheryl sent 9 pages air mail paper for 15¢ air mail which is only 4¢ more.</p>
<p>Since I have been here I have had many, many experiences. I have presented the first lesson to 2 groups of people. We have tracted about 600 doors. Had Group meetings in which we show the movie Qué es un Mormón (What is a Mormon). And last week started solely working directly with the members Building the confidence and knowledge in order that they will see better what their friends are missing, because it has gotten to the oint down here that Reuión de Grupe means I am busy to the members now. And last Sunday I baptized a lady that has been coming to Church for about a year but never was baptized. Her name is Juana Gillerma Gonzales de Bevilacqua. Last Monday we went to Rosario, a city of about 300,000 people to a Zone Conference. It is about 60 – 75 KM north of here. It was really a wonderful spiritual experience to partake of the Spirit of the other missionaries.</p>
<p>Tuesday we worked on the construction. They don’t have any block companies in this town so we have been making block since I have been down here. They expect to finish making block this week and start laying it as soon as the plumbing is all in.</p>
<p>I don’t know what I have told you about San Nicolas so I will just say everything now. San Nicolas is a town of 75 – 85,000 people. It is located north west of Buenos Aires on the edge of the campo or pampo. It is an important commercial city with the port of Siderurgia, where ships from all over the world stop.  There is a colony of around 50 families of U.S. birth outside of Siderurgia in one of the Barrios or Wards of the city. They work as technicians at the port and at a plastic plant here in San Nicolas. There are also lots of Germans, Italians, Japanese technicians here also. As far as Religion goes, Catholic is the main one, but there is a small Church of Christ, a Baptist missionary and a small Church founded on 12 apostles (the only other Church in the world with 12 apostles besides L.D.S.) and the L.D.S. Branch. The Rama or branch has a membership of around 200 – 250 members. It is one of the most active branches in the Mission. It includes people baptized in the 20’s &amp; 30’s up until strong converts baptized in the last year. Most of the young people are girls, especially if they are the only members in their families because of the customs and beliefs in chastity that are down here. It is hard to find a young person that has not broken the law of chastity.</p>
<p>In the way of sports, the kids love “futbol” or soccer as we called it in the states and love to try basketball and volleyball. Although they don’t play the same grade of game, they love to play them. Movies they get from all over the world, U.S. with Spanish lettering at the bottom, German, French, English, Italian, &amp; Japanese. They have radios, T.V.’s, cars, etc. They are not the same quality as in the U.S. but they enjoy them.</p>
<p>The people, very few may be, really believe in the Catholic Church, but because of tradition or they are able to do what they want they are still Catholics. Also some have gone to the other extreme and are atheists or communists, Fascists, etc. The Communists are not on the surface but you know that the influence is there.</p>
<p>I am glad to hear the kids are doing better in school. I hope they continue to improve.</p>
<p>The weather down here has really been hot and sticky but has cooled off today.</p>
<p>Today, yesterday, tomorrow and two more days next weekend are National Holidays. They are called Carnival Days. And are for the purpose of having fun. Something like Mardi Gras in New Orleans. All day long the kids have water fights, etc. and at night they dance, etc. I got hit by a water balloon yesterday and got soaked, but it was all right.</p>
<p>Today we are having a picnic to get the kids to bring their friends and have a testimony meeting, etc. I hope we get some good contacts out of it.</p>
<p>Sheryl is making a scrapbook for me so I am sending her most of the things I am collecting as I go along but I will try and send some to you, too. And you will receive the “Pompero,” the mission magazine. I asked Sheryl if she would like to have you send it to her when you are finished with it but I haven’t received an answer yet.</p>
<p>Well, I better quit writing for now and mail this letter. My hand is tired and my handwriting is getting worse so I will quit for now.</p>
<p>Love always,
Gary</p>

<p>Mis Querido familia</p>
<p>?Como esta? Bastaute bien yo espero – Yo se que mucho tiempo paso desde yo escribe una carta a Uds y lo sciento. Yo Estuvo muy ocupada la semana pasado y nortuve tiemp para excribir cactas. Ahora, nosatria (les mmisioners que estan aqui en San Nicolas y tambien todos en Argentian, tenema un Nuevo plan aceica de la manera de recibir investigaders. Ahora y en el future, trabajamas solamente con los miembras de la Iglesia y sus amigos. No es nueva plan en los Estados Unidas peso no usa aqui antes solamente. Realmente hay dos eazons por la cambio. Una es que mayer % de los mombra nuevas de la Iglesia porque hay amigas de miembros viejos y las atra razon es para que prepara las miembras aque pora un estaco y tambien para que todas los lideres squi seau Argentinas, missionares incluse.</p>
<p>[My beloved family,</p>
<p>How are you doing? Very well, I hope. I know it has been a long time since I have written and I am sorry. I was very busy last week and didn’t have time to write. Now all the missionaries here in San Nicolas, and all in Argentina, have a new plan for finding investigators. From now on we will only work with members and their friends. It isn’t new in the United States, but it has never been used here. There are actually two reasons for the change. One is that the majority of the new Church members are friends with old members and for that reason we are preparing the members here to be a stake and also so that the leaders and missionaries here will be all Argentine.]</p>
<p>I hope Tommy doesn’t have any trouble translating, the first page I got started and couldn’t stop; it is getting easier and easier to write and think in Spanish every day.</p>
<p>On this new program here we are not tracking, except when we don’t have anything to do.</p>
<p>Although we haven’t got any contacts from it yet, we receive some satisfaction because, there were more at Church yesterday than any time since I have been here. And the spirit of the members has been increased.
Also, we are talking to people on the street more than we have tried before and it seems to be increasing, more people seems to know something about the Church.</p>
<p>This program of giving the members uplifting thoughts has brought something to mind that I don’t have and that is any stories of a spiritual nature. We have been using ones in talks given at Conference.</p>
<p>There weren’t very many given, so I was wondering if there was a chance you could send me some books. I don’t know which ones, but some that have good spiritual stories in them. Also, something to study. I have used the B of M, Pearl of Great Price; Articles of Faith, Marvelous Work &amp; a Wonder, and I am studying D&amp;C, Bible, Jesus the Christ, now. On sending books, there hasn’t been much hold up if the package is marked “Books &amp; Libros.” Also send them Air Mail. It costs more but it is a lot faster and safer.</p>
<p>Well, I have some more letters to write so I better close and send this off.</p>
<p>Love always,
Gary</p>

<p>Dear Folks,</p>
<p>I was glad to receive Mother’s letter last week and Daddy’s yesterday. I also received the check yesterday, but I don’t know how long it took to get here because they sent it to Rosario and I got it when we went up for Zone Conference yesterday. It is good to hear what is going on at home.</p>
<p>Happy birthday to Ann &amp; Lydia. I guess this letter will be late for one and early for the other but I really do wish them Happy birthdays.</p>
<p>I’m glad Lorin is improving his grades. I just hope he can improve his English grade.</p>
<p>I hope Mother makes the R.S. Chorus, it really would be an experience and I hope all of you get to go up, since I won’t get to see the fair [the New York World’s Fair], I want someone to tell me about it.</p>
<p>Congratulations Tommy on being the best player’ it really makes me happy to know you are doing your best.
Things down here have been quite slow as far as investigators go; we have a few but they fell through. We really feel blessed to partake of the spirit that the members have here when we meet with them. I think that the members will come through real soon with some of their friends because they are getting the spirit of the plan.</p>
<p>We just received our Perspective [?], the Mission Magazine. You are supposed to receive  it too. It has the plan in it even though most of it is in Spanish. I hope you can understand it.</p>
<p>We also receive our January Eras &amp; Instructors.  And some Church News. I was really surprised to find the Y.M.C. of College Park Ward including me. I am sending the picture to Sheryl.</p>
<p>Yesterday when we were at the Zonal Conference we borrowed “Joseph Smith, American Prophet.” What I have read of it so far is really good and really show the life of Joseph Smith.</p>
<p>It rained a couple of days the last week so the rainy month of March is here. The streets were just rivers and when it was raining it was just like sheets of water.</p>
<p>The kids are all going back to school. The school starts about the first of August and goes till the end of November. That is the first semester. Then they are off during the summer till about March 1st and they go back to school till about the second week in July. And that is the year of school. Then they are off for about two weeks and start the next year.</p>
<p>Thank you very much for your prayers and I want you to know I love you all very much also and only want the best for all of you.</p>
<p>It is 10:30 and I have another letter to write so I better close.</p>
<p>Love always.
Gary</p>

<p>Dear Folks,</p>
<p>I am sorry that I didn’t get a letter written last week, I sat down a couple times to write but I got started and then had to go.</p>
<p>We have been pretty busy. Friday we started a softball activity. They don’t play softball down here hardly at all. They play a little in primary school but that is all. So the activity really attracts investigators. We had about 15 last Friday and half were investigators so I think we can really use the activity for a good use.</p>
<p>Then Saturday we had a Cena (banquet) supper in regards to the Kilo program, is the welfare plan down here, which really is the way they feed and clothe the construction missionaries. There were around 95 people there and about 10 investigators. They had Ravioli Alleman which are a German Ravioli but I can describe it since eat raviolis all the time and I can’t remember which is which. Soup, salad, and a fruit salad for dessert. Also an orange drink.</p>
<p>Did Sheryl’s Mother call you on the 20th? She said she would.</p>
<p>I was happy to receive the letters of all the kids. I wish I had time to answer them but I don’t. So I will try to keep up a letter a week to the family.</p>
<p>For my birthday I had a dinner of pancakes, ham, potatoes and a cake for dessert at the house of the building superintendent. It was unusual but it was sure good.</p>
<p>That is the only place we get to eat American food.</p>
<p>The weather has been pretty bad lately, raining for hours and hours and flooding everything, but it isn’t the  raining season yet I received a letter from the bishop and I am going to try to answer it today.</p>
<p>I guess Ilene and Terry are pretty busy. I haven’t heard from them in over a month.</p>
<p>I received a letter from Daddy’s parents but I haven’t answered it yet. I bought a pair of shoes last week; they seem to be pretty good shoes. They cost me $1200.00 pesos around $12.00. They are supposed to last me for a while. I bought them so I could have a pair to trade off with my others.</p>
<p>Well although I haven’t written in a while I can’t think of anything today so I will close and get it sent off.</p>
<p>Love always,
Gary</p>

<p>Dear Folks,</p>
<p>Well, I have let the time slip by again without writing again. I really have been busy. The day I wrote the last letter, I was told I was changing branches. The next day I packed and got on a bus and traveled south for 19 hours to a resort town on the coast in southern part of the Mission by the name of Necochea. That is where my branch is now. The town is of about 30,000 and its main industry is tourist. The branch is small, around 80 with 90-95 active [percentage?]. My companion is the branch president. His name is William Ward from Huntington, California, just outside of L.A. He is 29 and has 2 months left of his mission. He really is a wonderful guy and has a real testimony of the Gospel.</p>
<p>Well, I just was getting to know the branch and the tow (about a week later) and one of the Z.C. came down from Mar del Plata to say that he was going to work with my companion for a week and I was to go to Mar del to work with his companion. Well, that is where I am now. We work her Wed, Thurs, &amp; Friday. Friday night we took off to visit the branches and see how everything was going. We went to Tandil, Azul &amp; Olavarria which are Northwest of Mar del Plata. They are about the same size branches as Necochea except Tandil, which is larger. Also in the south there are branches at Tres Arroyos and Bahia Blanca. We are on the bus for around 12 hrs in all and stay one night at Olavarria and one at Tandil.</p>
<p>The people down here are different than those in the north. I can’t explain the difference but there is one. The people are generally richer here than in the north and because of the tourist trade are more modern. For example: in the north hardly anyone has running hot water in every tap but here it is common and there are more cars here than in the north.</p>
<p>I saw my first mountains while I was traveling the Z.C. over by Tandil. They remind me of some of those in Nevada, except the whole land is wetter.</p>
<p>Mar del Plata is a town of around 125,000 now but a month ago there was supposed to have been over a 1,000,000, but now it is fall and they have all left. Hotels, homes, businesses all have closed down with the change in weather.</p>
<p>I finally finished the roll of film I had in the camera and when I get some money I will send it home to be developed. It is a 36 picture roll and Kodak. They don’t develop States film down here.</p>
<p>The missionary work is coming along fine. They were supposed to have baptized a man in Necochea this week and there were baptisms in two or three of the other branches in the south.</p>
<p>I sometimes wonder if I am doing something wrong or if I ust haven’t had the opportunity with baptisms yet because one of the Elders that came down with me has had six already and that means 12 between him and his companion.</p>
<p>I guess it is not for me to say but for the Lord to decide who is ready and who is not.</p>
<p>I haven’t received any mail in quite a while because of the move and now me being up here and my mail in Necochea so how is everybody? I hope that the kids are coming along and improving in school. I finally received a letter from Ilene &amp; Terry but they are really busy, I guess.</p>
<p>We heard part of Conference tonight in Spanish but the power went off before it was over so we didn’t hear much. I guess we will have to wait till July or August when we will receive our five Era’s to find out everything about Conference.</p>
<p>I am running out of things to say now so I will close for now, but maybe I can think of something else tomorrow before I mail it.</p>
<p>April 6 – Well, I can’t think of anything else to say so I will close really now.</p>
<p>Remember I love you all so very much and my prayers are always for your safety and health.</p>
<p>Love always,
Gary</p>

<p>Dear Folks,</p>
<p>I received Mother’s letter of the 1 and Daddy’s of the 7th so I guess I better write.</p>
<p>Things really sound great at home. It sounds like the boys are really working hard in the yard and the house. And the weather really sounds wonderful. Here it is still warm in the sun but at night it really feels cold and since there is no central heat all we have is a little heater that burns on a tube of gas and it runs out and costs.</p>
<p>The work is looking better and better. The members are bringing some of their friends out so I think we will have some investigators pretty soon.</p>
<p>Next Monday we have a conference in B.A. [Buenos Aires] with Elder Kimball which we are looking forward to because of the new ideas and the Spirit he will bring.</p>
<p>I received a letter from Ilene yesterday and she really sounds busy but happy which I am really glad of.</p>
<p>A week ago just after MIA	I started to feel real dizzy and sick so I tried to go to bed and sleep. I was so weak that I hardly could get in bed but I did then I couldn’t sleep because I was shaking so much. I don’t know why even now unless it was the Devil because it wasn’t really cold and I had the heater and three blankets but still shook like I was freezing. I know I was sick from being worn out and lack of sleep but I think that it was more. I was all right after my companion administered to me. I could sleep in peace and slept all day Wednesday and after felt great but a little weak from not eating.</p>
<p>I am watching my sleep more now and trying to average around 8 hrs a night and eating the right foods.</p>
<p>My Spanish is still lacking quite a bit and even more now because I became lazy for a while and didn’t continue to study and lost some, I am sure.</p>
<p>The scriptures are the same. When I study them regularly, I remember more of all of them than if I try to just remember a lot I have memorized. Well, I am out of time right now so will have to stop.</p>
<p>Love Always,
Gary</p>

<p>Dear Folks,</p>
<p>I am sorry I haven’t written sooner this week but we have been awfully busy. We have been painting the Chapel with the help of the members. We haven’t finished yet but during the week we were painting all morning and then cleaning up and doing proselyting work in the afternoon and at night.</p>
<p>I received your letter. I am glad Tommy is keeping up in school. And than you for your words of wisdom. I knew that before but I guess I just wanted someone to tell me so. I know that I am doing the work of the Lord but as you said, I don’t quite know what the results of my efforts are or ever will be except that my knowledge of the scriptures has increased, my knowledge of the Church has increased my testimony and I am learning more of the problems of the Church and how to solve them and to meet and talk to people.</p>
<p>The weather here is still warm but it gets pretty cold at night and cool during the days.</p>
<p>We have been meeting with a young man lately that comes to church regularly since he has been in Necochea. He seems to open up and accept everything for awhile and then go back into a shell sort of atmosphere and won’t accept anything. I’m afraid that he doesn’t have the fortitude to make it. One reason is he is a friend of another fellow who has come to Church regularly since he has known about the Church but he doesn’t want to accept responsibility and be baptized.</p>
<p>Last weekend was district conference in Tres Arroyo and it was really wonderful. This district has 7 branches. The largest is in Mar del Plata, where I was two weeks ago, which has around 300 members. Also branches at Tandil (northwest of here around 120 miles, Azul y Olavarria – father north west); Tres Arroyos (120 miles south west); y Bahia Blanca, 350 miles south, south west. They all traveled to Tres Arroyos for the Conference. President Strong and his counselors, along with the Mission leaders of the auxiliaries, all were there. The spirit of the Lord really manifest itself on the people and I know that everyone felt it, even the investigators that were there.</p>
<p>Also they had interbranch volleyball &amp; basketball. We challenged the winning branch and got stomped. We hadn’t practiced or anything and none of us Elders could find the basket.</p>
<p>Well, I am running out of time so I will close for now so I will sign off this letter.</p>

<p>Dear Folks,</p>
<p>I haven’t received a letter since I last wrote but I have a few minutes so I will write.</p>
<p>Things here are about the same, but last Friday afternoon I broke out in a terrible rash and it kept getting worse. I went to the doctor and he said it was an allergenic reaction, probably from something I ate. He gave me a prescription and I went to a pharmacist and got all the medicine. And then went to a clinic to get the shots. Down here you buy the medicine yourself and then have a nurse or someone give you a shot.</p>
<p>I don’t know what it was I ate but it really caused a reaction.</p>
<p>Sunday there was the most spiritual meeting I have been in since I left Provo. It was fast day and I guess because I had fasted more than usual and felt more humble and the members felt the Spirit. Two of the young sisters couldn’t stop crying for about a half hour after the meeting. It is meetings like that that are a testimony more and more to me that the Lord is here with his children. That if I do my part, the Lord will give me results.</p>
<p>One of the sisters in the branch is going on a local mission here in Argentina and she really has the spirit to comfort her fellow countrymen.</p>
<p>Today we went and talked to the Catholic Priest. He really is intelligent and seems to be somewhat interested but today there were others present there so he wasn’t as open but he asked us to come back tomorrow. I hope we can help him to find the truth before he leaves next Sunday for Spain where his parents live, for a visit.</p>
<p>Also today we talked to the Director of Culture and Tourism about the Church a little bit and about sending him the Chore publications for publicity to him personally and he seemed real pleased.</p>
<p>And on the way back to the Church, the secretary of the newspaper stopped us and said that he had a friend that wanted to learn English but couldn’t come to our classes. We knew the secretary pretty well because everything that is printed in the newspaper goes through him so we talked to him once or twice a week. Well, anyway, the friend was the director of the newspaper or one of the most important and influential men in the town. We will have to see because he will be in B.A. [Buenos Aires] for the next week.</p>
<p>This all shows to me how much more the Church is accepted and known today. Because the people that we can talk to and feel that we are doing the work of the Lord and the reception that we get.</p>
<p>I mentioned earlier about fasting more. Well, what it is that my companion and I decided to fast Friday to more in the work and then we got a letter saying that there was going to be a mission-wide fast to help the work from Saturday night to Monday noon. So we fasted then, too. Also this week I am fasting with Sheryl, the seventh, to build our strength up together.</p>
<p>About her being in Washington, I don’t know when exactly but her family is going to the World’s Fair during this month of May and stop at Nauvoo, Kirtland, etc. And Sheryl asked her supervisor if she could go with them, even though it isn’t time for her to get a vacation and given the Okay.</p>
<p>Sheryl also isn’t living at home right now. She has taken an apartment about three blocks from her hospital and really likes it. She got her roommate through a computer company that matches people for roommates and so forth. Her roommate isn’t L.D.S. but seems to be a nice girl.</p>
<p>Well, I am running out of things to say so I will close for now and send it off.</p>

<p>Dear Folks,</p>
<p>I am sorry that I haven’t written, but I don’t know where the time flies.</p>
<p>I have been traveling again and have been awfully busy.</p>
<p>When we got back from the Conference, we had lots to catch up with here in Necochea because we were gone for two days and three nights.</p>
<p>And I didn’t sit down to write you till last Wednesday when the Z.C.’s walked in and one of them wanted me to on the road with him, as his companion, wanted work here.
We went to Tres Arroyos and then to Bahia Blanca. It is a city of around 160,000 and is a main port for ships, navy and marines. We stayed there around 4 days and returned last night. Elder Jacobs that was at Provo with me was there and it was sure great to get to see and talk to him again.
Here in Necochea my companion, Elder Ward, is going home tomorrow and so I will have a new companion, Elder Daniel Jones, from Van Nuys, California, which is another suburb of L.A., out by Palmdale. Things are really mixed up here and I don’t really have much time to write.</p>
<p>I got your letter when I got back and I am so glad that you got to see Sheryl and talk to her. She means so much to me and she wanted to meet you so.</p>
<p>Today I went and got the books out of customs and thank you so very much. It is just what I wanted. It cost me only about 10¢ to get them out and they are in wonderful shape. I think they arrived Friday but I wasn’t here.</p>
<p>I got my check too, and have paid off my bills and can see above water. I will have to write and thank Grandpa and Grandmother when I find time.</p>
<p>Well, I am out of time right now so I will close.</p>
<p>Love always,
Gary</p>

<p>Dear Folks</p>
<p>I am sorry that I haven’t written sooner but last week was just one big race.</p>
<p>It started out real fine. I don’t know if I mentioned this or not, but we had been meeting with this family we had come in in contact with through English class, but the girl, Mista, progressed faster than the rest of the family. Well, last Tuesday I baptized her in the ocean. She is 18, and really intelligent. Although the water was like ice, she said she didn’t feel a thing and I will always remember the look in her face and the tears in her eyes and the way she said thank you after I baptized her. If that was all the blessings I would receive for her baptism, it will be enough. Her family will all be members. I think we will baptize a few more this Saturday. They really are a wonderful family and will help the branch a lot here in Necochea.</p>
<p>That was Tuesday morning. Tuesday night something exploded in the branch between the members that was too hot for us to handle. It is something I will never forget and really something that taught me about pride. It stated out with a difference in opinion but kept growing until one side didn’t think we were knowing anything and didn’t have the authority and telegrammed the mission home.</p>
<p>Friday the President &amp; his wife came down and Saturday afternoon we had a meeting with both sides and everything is cooled off now. I have never felt so unsure of myself in my life as I have the past week and never learned so much about people in such a short time.</p>
<p>Well, it is all over with. I hope that they will be able to work together as one family o the members of the branch.</p>
<p>I received a letter from Ivan Keller and the Elder’s Quorum. I sure would like to answer it but I won’t have time today.</p>
<p>Saturday we worked with President Strong &amp; his wife. They sure have a wonderful spirit of the Lord’s work and are as friendly as can be.</p>
<p>Also Friday there was a seminar of music here with two of the lady missionaries who are working on music in the mission. It really was good and helpful to the members.</p>
<p>How are things doing there? The letter was really nice and that you for the picture so very much.</p>
<p>Well, I can’t think of anything else to say except I love all of you very much and miss you.</p>
<p>Love always,
Gary</p>
<p>P.S. Say Happy Birthday to Ruth for me
And Daddy,
Happy Father’s Day.
I don’t have time to make cards.</p>

<p>Dear Folks,</p>
<p>I am sorry as usual that I haven’t written sooner but I just haven’t had time. Last Saturday we had three baptisms. Two sisters of the girl we baptized a week ago and Jose Kristinusgo (?), the boy I mentioned before.</p>
<p>The two sisters of Mista were really happy, almost more than Mista was. Before the service we had a testimony meeting and Mista bore her testimony. I about felt like crying when she bore it, I was so happy. She has a strong, sweet testimony and it has grown so much in the last little while. I felt so very happy in knowing I helped her to gain it.</p>
<p>I had the privilege of baptizing her two sisters, Delia and Anaé. The water was like ice water and the surf was really strong with wind, bit waves and sand, but they both had the faith and I will always remember them. Their Mother and maybe their sister and two younger brothers will be baptized this following Sunday. I really have come to love this family. They remind me a lot of our family because they are a large family and have the lovely relationship that we have.
Sunday was the Conference of the Rama and now there is a local Branch President here which is a lot better and a step forward for the branch. Now we can spend the whole time looking and teaching those that have interest in learning the truth.
It has been quite cold here lately, about 30° F and lower. And without my sweater, I really would be cold. I also have bought a wool bufanda or scarf and Pierre hat to help me keep warm.</p>
<p>Monday we moved out of the Rama. We have been looking for an apartment for quite a long time and couldn’t find one in the center of town so finally [found one] in the plaza. It is really a nice apartment, overlooking a big park and a block from the ocean. It costs a little bit more than the apartment in the branch ($5.500) en vez de $5.000, but it is better all around. The branch needs the space for classes and we didn’t really have any privacy in the branch. That $5.500 a month between us is about $37.50 at the present rate of exchange. I received the check for July yesterday and the exchange was 147 pesos/$1 which is higher than it has ever been since I have been here.</p>
<p>The work is so very wonderful and I feel so much more enthused since we have had some baptisms.</p>
<p>How are things coming along? How did your singing go at the fair [New York World’s Fair], Mother? Was the fair exciting?</p>
<p>Tommy sounds like he is being a real good worker. I am so very glad.</p>
<p>Well, I am running out of time, so I will close and get this letter sent off this afternoon.</p>
<p>Give my love to everyone and Happy Birthday Mother, in case I don’t write again before your birthday.</p>
<p>Love you all so very much.</p>
<p>Love always,
Gary</p>
<p>P.S. Mail the letters to the same address.</p>

<p>Dear Folks,</p>
<p>I received Mother’s letter of the 24th of June during the visit and it really sounded like she had a full schedule but still had time to see part of the Fair.</p>
<p>Also about the fair, we finally received the Church News with the announcement and all about the Fair also the one with Mother’s picture in it, the one with all the sisters [practicing at Chevy Chase.</p>
<p>Things here are really, really bad. I have been in bed, sick with congested tubes to my ears, inflamed throat with pus and everything. I felt it coming but couldn’t do anything to stop it so I ended up in bed. I had to spend about $6-7 for medicines, antibiotics, dristan, shots, etc.</p>
<p>I feel much better now but I don’t know. I still feel pretty weak. I guess I better take better care of myself. Yesterday, since we couldn’t go to church, all the members missed us and about 15 or 16 came and visited us in the afternoon.</p>
<p>How are things coming these days at home? Are all the kids well and active? I bet it really is nice there in the hot sun.</p>
<p>Here it is cold, humid, but no snow. I think if I saw snow I would feel warm. I guess it is that I just never have been completely warm in so long, I can’t remember how it feels.
My study of the scriptures goes up and down. I don’t know why, but I read and even though the scriptures are so very wonderful, I guess my heart isn’t in it at that moment and they don’t mean anything to me. Then other times I come across one that really hits me to my toes and then I read and search with a determination that I have never known I had.</p>
<p>With the help of the Lord, these last six months I have really found am finding more out every day of what I really am. How weak and made up of emotions, worries, and fears.</p>
<p>When I know that I am doing the Lord’s work and have something to show for my efforts, everything goes a long smoothly. But when I am working hard but not with organization and surety that it is the right thing to be doing I feel insecure, mixed up; I don’t feel like I am accomplishing anything; I worry about everything – people, branch, money, Sheryl, companion, just everything. Things that I know I shouldn’t even be better with.</p>
<p>I know the Lord really is leading His work here on the earth. All the Elders here that are in leadership positions and such all have problems and all are different, but they are doing the jobs that they have been assigned.</p>
<p>This is another thing that is making me think. We have been told that Argentina is moving up, that now is the time. Well, the Lord much know this too, because the number of missionaries is increasing rapidly and before the end of the year there will be 180 missionaries in the mission. When I came, there were about 135-140. And right now there are only 15 missionaries above me or with more seniority that are now senior companions. Also, Elder Heath, who is 2nd Counselor in the mission told us that more and more companions are going to be made seniors at 7 &amp; 8 months and then to me he said, he didn’t want to say when, but I should be thinking about it. [Gary had been there just over six months, at this point.]</p>
<p>I really don’t know if I am ready or not, as a senior, but I know I have the ability so I better prepare even more because I am here to serve the Lord.</p>
<p>Tell the kids to study hard even during the summer. There is so much truth in this world to learn and we, as humans, have so little time to search and find this truth.</p>
<p>May the Lord bless you all
Write soon,
Love always,
Gary</p>

<p>Dear Folks,</p>
<p>I received Mother’s letter of July 4 and it really was an interesting letter. I am glad to know that the kids are using their time to learn more because they will really need the things they learn in the future.</p>
<p>They should be so thankful that they have an organized school system. Down here there are organized schools, but they are Catholic and they don’t include everything. The kids look for classes they can take in certain subjects and when a class is offered that they want, they just grab it.</p>
<p>The swimming really does sound refreshing to me, even weather that is warm enough to swim. I am not completely well yet. I don’t feel up to par and Saturday my companion came down with the same bug I had but he had a talk yesterday and got up to give it so I don’t know. I am in bed, writing so won’t bother him.</p>
<p>Wednesday we got an announcement that there was a special missionary conference in Bahia Blanca so Thursday we went to Bahia Blanca for a Zonal missionary conference with President Strong and Elder Heath, the first counselor in the mission. The theme was why aren’t we getting the baptisms we are supposed to be getting. For about 3 ½ hrs we gave ourselves a personal analysis and evaluation. And then President Strong tore us apart. First the Argentine Mission is the lowest in baptisms in S.A. [South America] but it has been prophesized to be the best. All the other missions with the same amount of missionaries are getting as many as 200 more baptisms a month and in the Church, during the first five months of ’64, when we got less than 400 baptisms, some of the missions got around 4,000. Why? Well that was the question. And the answer – well, I don’t know. We did decide that part of it was that we have not been strong enough in our decision and have not challenged our contacts enough, have been lazy, not dedicated as much as we could have been. I know that I haven’t been as dedicated as I should have. At times I should have been studying or thinking of ways to help certain members or investigators. I have talked about things at home, about the weather, Sheryl, lots of things that really are not bad, but are not good either.</p>
<p>President Strong said that since President McKay has said that every missionary should baptize one person a month at least, that a missionary shouldn’t ever feel like a missionary if he doesn’t do that. Well, in the six months I have been down here, I have had part in 10 baptisms but there were three months when there wasn’t any at all, so I guess that I was really down in the dumps for so long.</p>
<p>I hope in the future I can improve my effectiveness as a missionary (???) that the Lord’s work can progress even more rapidly here in Argentina.</p>
<p>Something I have learned since I have been on my mission is the importance of inviting friends and associates to the activities and meetings of the Church. I remember when the missionaries asked me about my friends and I told them that they weren’t interested; well, I guess really the situation was that I wasn’t interested in inviting them, that I was scared. The members tell us the same answers I used to tell the missionaries and we find an answer or a solution for every problem because now I have a testimony of the importance of group meetings in the homes of the members.</p>
<p>You can’t wait till the people come to you. You have to choose which ones you want at your group meeting and then figure out the way to prepare them to accept the challenge to become a member of the Church. This, too, is a commandment of God. First he said, “Every member a missionary” and then he told us how he said, yes, we have to have sports activities, public relations, English classes, etc. but the most effective way is that the members have group meetings in their homes with some of their friends.</p>
<p>I really hope and pray that while I am here that you can do your part there in Washington by inviting your friends, associates, etc. to a group meeting.</p>
<p>About money, I would like to say that I don’t need any more than the usual, but I (???) would you send an extra $5 or $10 (???) all of it because I will just waste it, I know.</p>
<p>Give my love to the Ward. I haven’t had time to write anyone lately, maybe today.</p>
<p>I might mention that Elder Mikesell [elder in the same mission, from his Ward in DC] and his companion had 7 baptisms a week ago, which really makes me feel happy and I know increased his testimony.</p>
<p>Love to everyone and think about who you can invite to a home meeting.</p>
<p>Love always,
Gary</p>

<p>Dear Folks,</p>
<p>I got Mother’s wonderful letter during the week. It is sure good to hear what is going on at home and that everything is going so well. I would like to hear more of what goes on in the ward. I guess I have changed my view of things because before I wasn’t interest[ed].</p>
<p>It was an interesting wonderful full week the past week. The members are really beginning to want to have group meetings or better “home meetings” and this branch is ready to explode wide open.</p>
<p>We had, as I think I told you, our first home meeting a week ago and at least two of those that attended are going to be baptized next Saturday. We baptized two more of the wonderful Romano family yesterday and the others are progressing rapidly. And then today was the cream of the crop. President Strong came to visit again but this time with President Tuttle. What a wonderful man of God. He has been visiting the branches in the Southern part of the Mission the past couple of days and spoke here this morning. We had an article yesterday, today, and also for tomorrow, a personal interview with someone from the local paper. All with photos.</p>
<p>There were fifteen investigators there and 3 I have never seen before.</p>
<p>President Strong &amp; President Tuttle both talked on the same things, repentance, doing your best, home meetings, missionaries for construction.</p>
<p>I have heard President Tuttle three times since I have been down here and every time he has just hit to the bottom of the problem. He said this is the best branch he has visited this trip which really makes me proud but all the more humble because of the responsibility that we have as missionaries to work with this potential.</p>
<p>After the meeting we went and ate with them and both him and Pres. Strong are so friendly, talkative and etc. when they are relaxing but so powerful when speaking for their calling. It makes me so much more sure of the responsibility that I have to prepare myself to meet the challenge here and wherever I am sent.</p>
<p>The Mission as a whole has really been suffering lately for baptisms even though the missionaries and everybody have been working so hard, but lately here and, I know, in the whole mission, things are ready to explode. There is just something in the air; the spirit in the meetings. All add up to an explosion that will blast the Mission wide open and up in baptisms, etc.</p>
<p>Today I have my first chance to translate in a meeting. Pres. Strong’s youngest son (14) came with him and was asked to speak. I have never been so scared in all my life. I felt like I was going to freeze up but I don’t know why or how but I did it and I guess it was the Spirit of God and not me because everyone told me that I had never spoken better Spanish.
I hope that you read can read this letter; I am writing pretty fast.</p>
<p>Tomorrow we are going to Tres Arroyos again for a monthly missionary meeting which is being started here in the South. Which is really good. One of the troubles down here is that sometimes we, as missionaries, feel all alone.</p>
<p>Give my love to everybody and tell them that the missionary here, there, everywhere in the world is ready to explode but we, as members, have to do the work.</p>
<p>Well, I will close for now.</p>
<p>Love always,
Gary</p>

<p>Dear Folks,</p>
<p>Another wonderful week has gone by here in the mission home. Each day I learn more and more of the great responsibility I have, first as a missionary and secondly, as a missionary in charge of the Literature Department and especially here in the Mission Home.</p>
<p>During the week something happened that was outstanding. Through one of the missionaries and a contact that they had, President Strong, President Stone of the North Mission and President Tuttle and a few missionaries visited President Illia of Argentina (Pres. Of Argentina) and talked to him for about 35 minutes, gave him a Book of Mormon. They said he was really friendly and seemed interested. They were on news cast that night on video tape and there were articles in the paper the next day.</p>
<p>I have really come to enjoy the Mission Home and the work of the Lord here that has to be done even though it isn’t what you think of as mission work.</p>
<p>Right now we are ordering more manuals and stuff for the Home Teaching program. Also manuals for the Sunday school.</p>
<p>In the printing room we have begun to print the new integration manual and we will probably finish this week. Next we will start on the Boy Scout manuals.</p>
<p>I am glad to hear that everything is fine at home and you have enjoyed your summer visitors.</p>
<p>Here in the Mission Home we have a few visitors also. One of the missionaries who is going home next Friday – his mother and Grandmother came down to go home with him. They are stopping in Washington on their way home and so don’t be surprised if you get a call in a couple of weeks. They are from Cal. And might be related to Daddy but I am not sure – there is a Mathews in their line, also Connors.</p>
<p>Well have to go.</p>
<p>???
Love,
Gary</p>

<p>Dear Folks,</p>
<p>I guess I have been a disaster this month as far as letter writing goes. I have a page in front of this pad that says Dec 13 and the letter wasn’t finished so it wasn’t send off or any sense then either. I am so very sorry and I guess it has only [been] because I am lazy.</p>
<p>I want to thank you all so very much for the support and love you send to me through your letters. Especially in the Special Christmas letter. Beforehand I knew of the letter and knew when it came, but Christmas Eve, when we opened the letters, my eyes were wet as the rest of them. Thanks so much.</p>
<p>We had a wonderful Christmas here. Christmas Eve we had a Kitchen Party here in the Mission Home and made candy and sweets for the next day.</p>
<p>Christmas morning Sis. Strong fixed us her husband’s favorite Christmas breakfast of pancakes, eggs and sausages. And it was wonderful. Then Christmas night we invited all the North American families over and had a program. There are now in B.A. [Buenos Aires]: 3 construction families and 5 families that are either working for the U.S. or Embassy including Pres. [Lee B.] Valentine who was President of the Mission about 10 years ago [1952-1956]. It was a very wonderful program with the Christmas spirit. There was a total of about 45 people.</p>
<p>Things are moving here so very fast. I can hardly keep track of the time. There are things I was planning to do a month ago that I still haven’t found time to do.</p>
<p>I am in wonderful health with no problems whatsoever except eating too much.</p>
<p>Well, I am worried again about all the work there is to do so I had better quit and start working.</p>
<p>Thank you again for your wonderful letters and I will write sooner this time.</p>
<p>Love Always

<p>Dear Folks,</p>
<p>Another week has gone flying by and it is time to write my wonderful folks and family. I want to tell you again right now how much I love you and appreciate all the things you have done for me during my life; especially during the past few years that I have been away. Every time I read in the Book of Mormon, when one of the prophets starts by “being born of goodly parents,” I almost cry with the jo and gladness that I too have this pleasure without payment. So, Mom &amp; Dad – Thanks.</p>
<p>It is so much of a pleasure to be back out in the field doing proselyting work. The joy that I feel every day, talking to the members and feeling their wonderful, humble spirits and their desire to serve the Lord and comply with his commandments. And to meet people and watch them change their ideas and eventually their lives and see the change in their character and face from sadness to happiness. I am so thankful that I have had the chance to come to Argentina. I love the office also and grew a lot there as far as my character goes, but it isn’t the same as the proselyting work.</p>
<p>The branch of Ezeiza is progressing immensely. More members are coming out and taking part than way before. We have been visiting inactive members and challenging them to comply and attend church and a few of them came out yesterday to church.</p>
<p>Also, we have been tracting and have got into a few homes to teach lessons and I think maybe we will be able to teach a few some more lessons and eventually baptize them.</p>
<p>Give my love to Ruth, will you?</p>
<p>I guess I better go now. So goodbye for now.</p>
<p>Love always
Your son

<p>It seems like a long time since I have written you and I guess it has been.</p>
<p>A lot of things have happened since then. As I mentioned last letter, I have moved out of the office but now I know where I am. I am working in a branch by the name of Ezeiza.
The international airport for BA [Buenos Aires] is located near here but we live in a barrio by the name of General Belgrano. My companion is named Jay McKensie and is a new Elder from Preston, Idaho. When we moved in here we didn’t take anyone’s place, just more elders working in the barrio. There is also another set of Elders and a set of Hermanas (Sisters). From what I have seen so far, the members are really wonderful but a little weak as far as being strong characters and able to stand alone.</p>
<p>We live in an apartment now. At first we lived in the branch and slept on benches because we didn’t have any beds. The apartment is pretty nice but will be better after it is completely fixed up. There are two bedrooms and a large living/dining room combination with kitchen and bathroom at their sides. The barrio or ward is one of the few I have evern seen that has lawn in front of every house. It really is a beautiful area. We have been tracking and the people are quite receptive to the gospel although the members themselves are quite against inviting their friends out to Church and having Home Meetings.</p>
<p>By the way, how are the “home meetings” coming at home? Or are they?</p>
<p>The other elders that live here with us are really good. Elder William is the senior elder and goes home in May, I think, and really progressed since the last time I saw him almost a year ago. His companion is Elder Berry from Boulder City, Nevada. The sisters are both Argentines and are wonderful sisters.</p>
<p>Well, time is valuable and I can’t think of anything else important to say so I will close for now.</p>
<p>Love always,
Gary</p>
<p>P.S. My address is
Elder Gary A. Mathews

<p>Dear Folks – Dad, Mom, Ruth, Tommy, Lorin, Dennis, Lydia, Ann, Susan,</p>
<p>How are ya? Things are just great down here. The Lord’s work is coming along.</p>
<p>Today we had a wonderful Zone Conference with now challenges and acceptances to the challenges. The theme of the Conference was “By Your Fruits, You Will Be Known.” It was really good. Some of the ideas that came out of it are excellent in everything. Lately I have been reading a book on “Positive Mental Attitude” and the same ideas came out in the Conference, that a person that can control his thoughts will be a success in whatever he is doing. The thoughts don’t make him a success but with the thoughts definite and organized, he will do the action it takes him to be a success. That the idea of not making a success will for a certainty make a person unsuccessful. For example: a missionary that doesn’t have any confidence in himself will never be a leader unless he changes his attitude. About spiritual things, I think that you would call it your faith in God.</p>
<p>We have a baptism for Wednesday and the people here are just wonderful, as far as teaching goes.</p>
<p>How is Ruth coming? I am sure she is just wonderful.</p>
<p>Mother &amp; Dad, I want to tell you again how much I really love and respect you and I am so thankful that I was bless to have such wonderful parents.</p>
<p>Thanks always,
Gary</p>

<p>Dear Folks,</p>
<p>I received your wonderful letter, thank you so very much for the wonderful letters that you always write me; they re-enthuse me and make me more determined to do the Lord’s work. I am so sorry that I have been so slow so many times to write and to write more what I am doing.</p>
<p>On your questions: R de H means Reuniones del Hogar which means home meetings or meetings in the homes of members with investigator, teaching the gospel.</p>
<p>Tommy – study hard in Spanish. I really regret that I didn’t in High School. I would be so much better off now if I had. On conference – we hear re-broadcasts in Spanish and for the first time in the mission home, they heard a re-broadcast in English also – I will enclose the notice we got.</p>
<p>Here in Argentina the work of the Lord is moving on at an unbelievable rate. We were privileged to have another baptism this week. A young girl – 19 ½, who knew about the Church over a year ago but when the missionaries wanted to teach her, her parents said no, so she had to wait until she was of age. She has a wonderful spirit of the Lord and really wants to comply with the Lord’s commandments.</p>
<p>We also did some more tracking this week and I really can feel the spirit of the Lord working through me to help these wonderful Argentine people accept the Church – the last part of last week we knocked on a door and a lday answered. We have been using a flip-board with pictures over Relief Society, Priesthood &amp; the family and to those who want to know more – a color brochure – (something like Mormon’s Story)and then setting up a date to pick up the color brochure and finding out if they want to know more. Anyway, this lady said that her husband, who is a school teacher of military techniques and mathematics, I think, was interested and couldn’t we come back Saturday morning. I woke up Saturday morning scared. I don’t know why but I knew it had something to do with talking to this professor. We went by once and nobody answered. So we went and did all the other things we had planned and back at night.</p>
<p>When we walked in the house I could feel the brightness of his personality and intelligence just flowing from him but I also knew I could talk to him about anything on his plane of talk because I felt the spirit of the Lord in me. He was one of the deepest thinkers I have ever talked to in my mission but through the help of the Spirit of the Lord I was able to speak to him using his type of Spanish and answered all his questions. We don’t know yet if he has interest or not but I feel so blessed of the Lord for the blessings I have. My companion said after the meeting that he had never heard me speak better Spanish or be so sure of myself and I knew it was all the spirit within me.</p>
<p>We are still working hard, searching for leaders for the church here in Argentina.</p>
<p>It sounds great, the idea that the missionaries there have confidence in you and your judgement. How are your plans for home meetings coming? And how did that family that Daddy was working with go? Were they baptized?</p>
<p>How is the ward coming, getting larger &amp; larger every Sunday? I want to write more people but it is so hard to find time to even write the letters that are necessary to write. So give my love to everyone and tell them I think of them often.</p>
<p>Well, I have to go so I will sign off for now and remember always that I love you all.</p>
<p>May God Bless and keep you.
Love,
Gary</p>

<p>Dear Folks,</p>
<p>I let another week go by without writing and I am sorry, but thanks for the wonderful letters that have sent me.</p>
<p>I am fine and working hard in the Lords work. I feel time slipping by faster and faster and I can’t really see that I have done anything. The Lord is blessing me with more blessing than I am worth.</p>
<p>I come to love Argentina and the people here more and more each day. Especially the members of the Church here that are catching the vision of the Church and doing their part to further the Church and the Lord’s work.</p>
<p>I especially feel blessed to have worked in the mission home and now in the branch of Ezeiza. As I have mentioned before, the people here are of high quality and intelligent and really are a choice people.
Last Sunday was branch conference and the brethren of the District were here. Pte. Gianfelice (Dist. Pres.) is really a wonderful, humble man. Every time I hear him speak I like him more. He has a profound knowledge of the scriptures and the gospel and is able to explain it in a way that everyone can understand it.</p>
<p>Also the men of the family were passed on to receive the priesthood. And yesterday the boys passed the Sacrament for the first tie and it really was a joy to me to watch them and know I started them on the road.</p>
<p>Saturday eight elders left for the states, having finished their missions, all as leaders of the mission. And it makes me realize even more how much I have to prepare myself in the short time I have left.</p>
<p>About the ward being divided, I heard rumors a while ago from Richard Andros, but since you didn’t say anything I didn’t think anything of it.</p>
<p>Well, I have to clean up the apartment so I’d better sign off for now.</p>
<p>Give my love to Ruth and everybody.</p>
<p>May the Lord always watch over you and guide you.</p>
<p>Your son
With love
Gary</p>

<p>Mis Queridas,</p>
<p>Es un placer paras la abra del sieve para escriubirles a Vasotios.</p>
<p>[Dear loved ones,
It is a pleasure to be able to write you.]</p>
<p>The Lord’s work here is moving along at a terrific rate and I can see that also He is manifesting his work there in College Park also. I feel the Lord’s sprit more and more every day manifested through my work here in Argentina.</p>
<p>The past week we have worked extra hard in the idea that we are now trying to use our time more effectively; to talk to someone in every house we knock on about the Church and to leave a folleto (pamphlet). We have had quite a bit of success but we want to progress even more.</p>
<p>The biggest problem I have right now is that I am scared that my mission will be over before I have done what I feel is worth the blessings that I have received since I have been on my mission.</p>
<p>I have never seen time fly by so fast in my life and it doesn’t slow down at all, it is just going by faster. I have been here three months and that is half the time that I was in the mission home and now it seems that I am just running all the time.</p>
<p>With the new ward, well there will three wards meeting now in the Chapel? Or is Silver Spring meeting someplace else now?</p>
<p>With the two wards, I feel a little bit different now, having to represent two wards instead of one.</p>
<p>I know the Lord is blessing his people to see the progress in his work in the world.</p>
<p>Say Hello to Ruth for me and to the two Bishops. If I find their addresses, I will try to write them both.</p>
<p>Love always,
Gary</p>

<p>Dear Dad, Mom, Ruth, Tom, Lorin, Dennis, Lydia, Ann, Susan,</p>
<p>Another wonderful week has gone by here in the work of the Lord and I am happy. We haven’t had any baptisms as of yet but we have met some wonderful people. My companion is wonderful and has a wonderful spirit and a desire to serve the Lord.</p>
<p>Yesterday was the District Conference of the district in which we are working and it was wonderful. It is a testimony to me to see the progress in the members of the Church here. The Conference was held in the chapel of the Villa Saronient Branch which was just finished a couple of months ago and it really is nice. There are about 1200 members sin the district and about 40% came out for the meetings. Members outstanding, leaders and others copaz and wanting to comply with the wishes of the Lord and the meetings were outstanding; with talks by District leaders and missionaries on their way home.</p>
<p>Today we had a wonderful Conference of missionaries with President Strong, his wife and the elder in charge of proselyting. After they talked, we had a wonderful four hours of testimonies. Although it has only been a month, it was good to see the Strong’s again. I really learned to love them while in the mission home.</p>
<p>The weather has been cooler lately and raining quite a bit. I guess the fall is coming in agin.</p>
<p>About my address, I will explain:
	Mono bloc. 3 ---- Apartment building 3;
	Manzana 3 ----- block 3; Dto 2 ----- Apartment 2
	Secion 1 ----- Section 1; Cucunscipcion 1a ----- Area 1a</p>
<p>And the block of six letters were the train line the mail came on. Here our mail comes out by truck, as we don’t live on any main train line. The letters like FCNGR mean Ferrocrnil Nacional General Roca or FCNGBM, Ferrocaril Nacional General Barlthome Mitre; etc.</p>
<p>My Spanish has improved a lot, according to everybody and I guess it is because I knew I had to say it right because no one else is going to say it for me – that it is up to me.</p>
<p>Well, I can’t think of anything else to say so I will close for now.</p>
<p>Love
Gary</p>

<p>Dear Folks,</p>
<p>I received your wonderful letter. It really is a boast every week from home to receive a letter and feel the warmth and love come out through the lines.</p>
<p>My love for all of you grows and grows each day and month.</p>
<p>The past week has been quite a successful week, as we have taught quite a few lessons and helped members to progress in the Church. I feel like I am working quite hard but that I am still wasting quite a bit of time.
We have [been] working with quite a lot of contacts and it is pretty definite that we will be able to get some in the water this coming week.</p>
<p>I feel moe and more unsure of myself when I think of the future. I can see ahead responsibilities as the time goes along in the mission and I don’t feel ready or prepared to accept them and do a good job.
I know how you must have felt not knowing half the ward because it happens to me here all the time. It is especially bad when they know me but I can’t remember their name or where to place them in my memory.</p>
<p>How is Ruth doing? I hope that she is improving if not the same.</p>
<p>Well, the Lord’s work must go on. I feel so rushed sometimes but it is so important to keep busy.</p>
<p>May the Lord watch over you always.</p>
<p>Love always,
Gary</p>

<p>Dear Folks</p>
<p>Another wonderful week in the work of the Lord has gone by and I had the wonderful blessing to receive two uplifting letters from home. Thanks folks.</p>
<p>We have done a lot the past week and work hard. The Lord is blessing more and more everyday here in Argentina. I feel so very wonderful.</p>
<p>Mom, it really sounds wonderful and exciting to hear the way you are helping the Lord’s work there at home. It makes me feel more proud of the fabulous parents I have. Good luck in receiving more contacts for the missionaries.</p>
<p>Say hello to Sister Gibson for me, will you.
Dad and boys, I am glad that you are finding time to do what you love, that is to build the houses of prayer of our Lord and Savior.
Lydia, I feel sorry that I am not able to be there to help you in your time of need. I know that you are a big girl now and won’t be of any problem to anyone. The brace will be a big help to you. I know. Honey, my prayers and thoughts are with you and I know with your faith that you will get better.
Lorin, I am proud of you if, as Mother says, you have lost weight. Keep up the good work.</p>
<p>Mom, I have been meaning to ask, a couple of weeks before I left the mission home, I sent a couple of packages by boat of old letters, souvenirs, etc. Have they arrived? If not, tell me anyway so I can have them traced.</p>
<p>Also, I have had quite a few people ask me about Washington and I can tell them, but I can’t show them anything so if it wouldn’t be too much bother, could you collect a few post cards, maps, pictures, etc. and send them to me air mail. Especially one of those picture maps of downtown Washington.</p>
<p>The experiences you, as a family, are having in the home night program are probably very spiritual, as well as being quite enjoyable.</p>
<p>Here in Argentina the blessed members are working hard to prepare themselves to use that excellent lesson manual to strengthen their families here.</p>
<p>The people here are really wonderful. We have been teaching a couple of real fantastic people who are humbling themselves before the Lord to obey his eternal commandments. I really feel blessed to be here and feel the power of the Lord working on and through my veins.</p>
<p>The Pampero came out today and it really looks good. The mission has really come a long ways in the past while, especially in the determination of the missionaries to do the work of the Lord.</p>
<p>Dad – I asked you, I think, once to send me a copy of your line of authority in the priesthood. I don’t really feel that I should be without it.</p>
<p>Speaking of being without things – a couple of days ago I was going through some of my things, checking on what I have and I couldn’t find my selective service card or classification notice. I lost my pocket wallet awhile back and it must have been in there. I don’t know if I should check out through the American Embassy here or have you do it there. I don’t know the number even, or the number of the board. I memorized the number once but I don’t have any idea now at all. Could you call or check what I should do from there. I know the boards for the D of Columbia are in the District Building.</p>
<p>Well, it is getting late and I better close so I will mention again how much I love every one of you and my prayers always include your welfare.</p>
<p>May God bless every one of you.</p>
<p>Love always,
Gary</p>

<p>Dear Folks,</p>
<p>I have really been slow again in writing you and I am sorry.</p>
<p>I received the maps and information on the World’s Fair – thank you. Also for your letter of May 17.</p>
<p>Mother, on that piece of paper, I am not sure exactly what it is. I have an idea so I will mention it anyway I think it would be better if you sent it all to me, including the envelope it came in. My idea is this, about 7 or 8 months ago, one of the Branch Presidents in B.A. [Buenos Aires] asked me if I had a relative that had been in Argentina before on a mission or in the Marines. I told him not that I knew of and asked him why. He said that there was a young girl (14 or 15) who had just come to B.A. from “Salta,” whose name was Matthews and was looking for her relatives. Well, I said I was sorry but I couldn’t help. About a week later the girl came in. I talked to her and she said that her father had just died and so she was looking for her father or his relatives. It sounded to me like her Father was a Marine or sailor and had married her Mother during the war and never came back. Well, anyway, I talked to Pres. Strong and he felt the same way that even though the circumstances were mixed up, she wanted a free ticket to the States. I told her that I was sorry and [even] though our name was the same, that I couldn’t help her, but I gave her my card, which has our home address.</p>
<p>That is the only thing that I think it could be so I know it would be better if I receive it and just turn it over to the mission.</p>
<p>How is Lydia coming? I hope that she is improving at a fantastic rate.</p>
<p>On the list of authorative – thanks for making it but I think you forgot to inclose it in the letter.</p>
<p>On my selective service. I registered in Idaho but the board transferred the record to one of the boards in D.C. so I can’t remember what the number was but I will try writing to the boards in Washington – Yes, I did lose my driver’s license.</p>
<p>Lydia &amp; Ann – keep up your music studies – I am proud of you just like I am of your brothers for learning to play an instrument.</p>
<p>[there must be more to this letter – somewhere]</p>

<p>Dear Folks,</p>
<p>I am sorry that I haven’t taken the time to write you sooner. I am getting a bad habit again of not writing letters.</p>
<p>I am fine and the work is just wonderful. Last Saturday the branch had an activity and there were five or six investigators there all day and at night there was a district activity and there were 12 investigators there from our branch. The members are beginning to catch the spirit and ask the golden questions.</p>
<p>Sunday the Branch Presidency was changed and the second counselor became president and the old president moved up into the District. The new President is young and has lots of good ideas. I am sure we will be able to work with him.</p>
<p>On the letter of that girl, I called and talked to President Strong and he said it would be better to let it sit and wait to see if anything else develops so I will let you know as things develop, but be sure and send me anything else that arrives there.</p>
<p>Tell Ruth Happy Birthday for me since I am late in writing.</p>
<p>Also, where is Ilene? The last letter I got from her said she was thinking of going home and so I don’t know where to write her very well.</p>
<p>Well, time is short so I better close.
May the Lord bless and watch over all of you.</p>
<p>Sincerely, your son</p>
<p>With love
Gary</p>
<p>P.S. I bought a new sweater last weekend. I am afraid it will make me a little short so could you send me a little more [money] for July.   Thanks.</p>

<p>Dear Folks,</p>
<p>The latest news I can tell you is that I have been changed. I am now in the branch of Rosario Centro. The address is Mendoza 3425, Rosario FCMGBM, Prov. B.A., Argentina. I was changed last Thursday but we have been so busy that I haven’t been able to find tie to write and yesterday I was so tired that I couldn’t see straight to write.</p>
<p>Why we have been busy is this: The B.Y.U. basketball team was here and the Elder I had replaced was in charge of everything as far as arranging goes. And there were some problems, etc. that needed to be fixed. Also a group of five missionaries that are singing as a group from the Uruguayan and Argentine missions were here and stayed in our apartment.</p>
<p>My new companion is named Melvin R. Grove and is from Rock Springs, Wyoming. He is a very good elder and has been down about eight months and should be made a senior companion pretty soon.</p>
<p>The branch is building a new chapel that should be built in about two months. A real wonderful branch with problems, of course, but it has a real fine spirit.</p>
<p>Well, I haven’t written much so I will wright more later but I want to get this sent off so I will close for now.</p>
<p>Love always,</p>
<p>Your son,
Gary</p>

<p>Dear Folks,</p>
<p>Time flies by faster and faster all the time. I can’t even remember when I last wrote you a decent letter so I better do it today.</p>
<p>As I mentioned last letter, I am in Rosario now, in the branch of Rosario Centro. I arrived here the 17th of June from Ezeiza into a mess. The Elder I was replacing was in charge of some activities and wasn’t planning on leaving till the 21. So there wasn’t a bed I could sleep on except the floor. The next day a group of five Elders, called the Quintet Mormon, which is touring the Argentine and Uruguayan Mission, singing and creating a good name and friends for the Chruch. They were up to sing over the weekend, but there weren’t any hotels, so they slept in our apartment also. Since they were guests, we let them sleep in the beds (5 in 4 beds) and the of us (5) slept on the floor.</p>
<p>Also, in the after, the B.Y.U. basketball team arrived and they were in our hands also. The two groups were the main problem until they were all gone, with Elder Deaverux (the Elder I replaced) on Monday morning. Then I started to unpack after being here 4 days.
Well, the next three of four days was just the usual problems of being in a new branch and getting to know everything and body. Sunday was District Conference in San Nicolas, in the new chapel. What a blessing it was to go back and see all the wonderful people back there in San Nicolas and to see the beautiful, beautiful Chapel they have built. The branch there has really progressed.</p>
<p>Monday we had a conference with President &amp; Sister Strong here in Rosario. It was good to see them again. Then we started it again. The apartment in which we were living wasn’t the best and since the contract had run out, the elders had found another apartment. And we started moving into it. The construction supervisor let us use his truck to do the hauling, but it took longer than we thought. One of the things that took a while was our roperos (wardrobe) was too big to go out through the doors into the hall of the building, so we had to lift them over the wall.</p>
<p>I hope you understand my pictures or my explanation. Anyway, we are now living in a smaller but more comfortable apartment.</p>
<p>The address is Francia 936, Rosario, FCNGBM.</p>
<p>I can’t remember if I mentioned my companions name or not. Anyway, he is Melvin Grove from Rock Springs, Wyoming. He has been down for about 8 months and should be made a senior pretty soon. He is really a good elder.</p>
<p>I haven’t received any mail from you since I have gotten here, but I know you have written. I am fine except for money. As I mentioned, I bought a sweater and now with the move, I am flat broke, but the check will be getting here pretty soon and if I need any more, I will tell you.</p>
<p>Happy Birthday Mother and let me tell you how much I really love you and want to tell you so. Thanks for everything.</p>
<p>By the way, where is Ilene? I haven’t heard from her and I don’t know where to write her.</p>
<p>Well, time’s up so I better close and run.</p>
<p>Love always,
Gary</p>

<p>Dear Folks,</p>
<p>Well, it is time to write those that I love again, even though I haven’t yet received word form them.</p>
<p>Things are going to be real great here in Rosario. I really feel like I am going to have success here in Rosario Centro. The people are really wonderful.</p>
<p>Yesterday our district of missionaries visited the “John Deer Tractor” factory her in Rosario. It really looked good and was very modern. About $250 million is invested in equipment, etc. here and about 2,000 people working there.</p>
<p>We are finally settled in our new apartment and now are working hard to find people to teach the gospel.</p>
<p>We have met one family and are going to teach them this week, but they are going to move to the States as soon as they can.</p>
<p>Sunday night after church we had a family hour with the building supervisor and his family. It sure reminded me of home and our family.</p>
<p>About the money. I know that I am going to run short before the end of the month so, if you could, please send $15 extra in August.</p>
<p>The Lord’s work is really outstanding and I love it.</p>
<p>May His spirit always be with you.</p>
<p>Love,
Gary</p>

<p>Dear Dad, Ilene, Ruth, Tom, Lorin, Dennis, Lydia, Ann, Susan,</p>
<p>What a privilege I have of writing so many wonderful people. I finally received all the mail, including the last one of Ilene’s.
Dad, Ilene, and Dennis – you must have had a wonderful time at the reunion. It sounds like I am not going to know anybody when I return.</p>
<p>Lydia – I am proud of you for being such a big girl and taking the brace, knowing all along what a big help it will do for you.</p>
<p>Lydia and Ann – I am proud of you for your determination to learn how to play instruments and to learn music.</p>
<p>Tommy – I hope you have a good time at the fair and the Convention. See everything for me since it will be gone before I get back.</p>
<p>Things here are coming along fine except they are a lot slower than I want them to be. The people are almost as hard-hearted as trees but we are finding some that show interest, especially as the chapel here is almost finished and things are moving along.</p>
<p>How does Washington look to you, Ilene – and I bet you are lonesome – Right?</p>
<p>Well, time is short so I will close – keep the Home lights burning.</p>

<p>Dear Mom:</p>
<p>I was sort of shocked to get your letter and to see the return address in Woodland Hills, California and te first thing I thought of was that something had happened. I am glad that it wasn’t bad and that the main reason was for a vacation for you.</p>
<p>How is everyone out there in California? And how long will you be staying there?</p>
<p>Things here are real fine. They are going slow and we are having a hard time in finding contacts but our progress is noticeable. I really feel privileged to be here serving the Lord and doing His work, probably more than I can really realize.</p>
<p>All the letters finally caught up to me and I feel a bit different in receiving so many letters in one week and now I can understand a little bit better what has happened in the past little while up there in the states.</p>
<p>We have been doing a lot of tracting lately and it is sure interesting to meet so many different people and listen to the most sometimes stupid reasons for not listening to the Lord’s message and for not accepting the truth, but there is one thing in common: no one wants to be truthful and come out directly and say yes or no.</p>
<p>Well, Mom, I want to take this chance to say how much I really love you and thank the Lord for the privilege of being your son and I hope I can always do the things you want me to do.</p>
<p>Give my love to all the folks out there.</p>
<p>Love always,
Gary</p>

<p>Dear Folks,</p>
<p>I hope you haven’t been worried over e and I am sorry that I haven’t written you sooner. Things are real fine here in Olavarria but I am not organized yet.</p>
<p>It is really an experience to be Pte. [President] of a branch. The branch here is small (61) members and the town is very, very hard. The Church has been here around 4 or 5 years and hasn’t progressed very much at all during my mission. The people are wonderful – like I mentioned before. I love the south more than any other part of Argentina. When I was down south before, the whole south was in one district. In order that each group of branches could grow faster, the mission split the south into three districts. Our district here is probably the smallest and the one that has the furthest to go. It has three branches, Azul, Olavarria y Tandil. The district president and two of the branch pres. are missionaries. Also there is very little priesthood, especially Melchizedek, and only around 210 members in the whole district.</p>
<p>My companion is David Sharp from ?? What I mean is that he isn’t sure, either. He left for his mission from Salt Lake, from his grandmother’s house. His Father is an Army career man and right now is in Texas and hoping not to go to Viet Nam. His Mother is in Seattle and before they have lived about everywhere, Baltimore, Germany, Okinawa, Japan, etc. He has been down about eight months and really is a fine elder.</p>
<p>I really like it here in Olavarria as I mentioned. It is a town of around 60 thousand, mostly farming with a little industry but really out in the country. Yesterday we went out again and visited one of the few complete member families. He works on a big estate, taking care of the animals. It is about 5 miles out in the country (yes, we are riding bicycles and I hope my slacks hold out). The last 2 miles is on a dirt road and I didn’t know but they still don’t have electricity. They care for about 60-70 head of cattle, 100 sheep, chickens, dogs (10-15), cats, geese, ducks, and every other type of animal you can think of, but they are really happy together out there and they have two of the cutest kids you will ever see.</p>
<p>Elder Tasman Johnson is the br. Pres. In the branch of Azul – about 55 minutes by bus from here. He was my companion in Provo and it is good to work with him again. I do most of my traveling with him as branch president, like Sunday afternoon we went together to Tandil for pres. Conference and our companions had to stay to take care of Sacrament Meeting. Travel on Monday for the missionary meeting.</p>
<p>Next Monday we all travel to Tres Arroyos for a conference with Pres. Strong. And on the 5 of September we have to travel to Mar Del Plata for a conference to start home teaching here.</p>
<p>I am finding it hard still to divide my time evenly between branch president and missionary, especially since the books of the branch are such a mess but I know I am also here to find someone who can replace me in the future and to build the branch membership up.</p>
<p>The time sure flies by and even though I don’t want to think of it, I know I have just over five months left and that I should look to the future. I would like to go back to school at the Y but since I don’t have any money I don’t know. What do you think?</p>
<p>By the way, I did finally write the selective service board and they sent a duplicate right out, but I don’t know what to do about the driver’s license.</p>
<p>Well, I better close this and send it to you so you can read.</p>
<p>Remember, please, that I love you all and I hope the Lord will bless you.</p>
<p>Love, Gary</p>

<p>Dear Folks.</p>
<p>Well, the time keeps flying by here in Olavarria and I don’t get around to writing you till I eel bad not to have written you.
I am learning to love but yet feel more the work of a branch president. I can also see more and more the responsibility of a bishop. I don’t know what I am doing but the Lord is sure blessing me here in the branch. Last night there was an attendance of 35 which included 5 investigators. That is about 15 more than usually come out. Also, those complying with the law of tithing has increased almost double over the past month.</p>
<p>Last Monday we had a conference in Tres Aroyos with all the Elders of the south and Pte [President] &amp; Sis. Strong. I saw Elder Andras and he looked well and the main thing is that he has grown up spiritually and mentally. He is working in Tres Aroyos.
I am getting to know Olavarria pretty well and I really love here, of course, I have always loved the south and, as you can see by the attendance at church, we are having pretty good success. The thing that is such a testimony to me is that those that were there came on their own and not through any labors of mine.</p>
<p>Saturday we are going to baptize a lady of 33 that has a stronger testimony than most members. She first heard of the church about ten years ago in the north but was working in a home of a staunch Catholic and couldn’t talk to the missionaries. So ever since then she has been praying for the truth and now she has the chance. She read the Book of Mormon in three days and knew it was true. Already she was complying with everything and really is one of the strongest character persons I have ever taught and is eager to learn; it almost shacks me to feel the Spirit of the Lord working so very much in one person after seeing so many others that don’t even care, but it just proves that the Lord calls those that are ready.</p>
<p>In one way I feel more relaxed right now than any other time in my mission because I know that I have to make the decision for everything that is done here in the church and I know that if I am faithful, the Lord will help me to make the right ones.</p>
<p>Mom &amp; Dad, I keep forgetting to repeat how much I love and respect you for what you have done for me in my life and the example that you have given me.</p>
<p>Say hello to everyone for me and give my love to Ruth.</p>
<p>Love always,
Gary A. Mathews</p>

<p>Dear Folks,</p>
<p>Well, time is still flying by and I don’t write. As usual I feel badly, but I just don’t organize my time enough.</p>
<p>Things are wonderful here. Two weeks ago, when we went to District Conference, there were 27 that went from our branch, which is real good, I think, considering there are 66 members.</p>
<p>As far as finding people to teach, we aren’t having much luck, though I know that there are people here that want to know the truth. We are teaching or trying to teach three families that came looking for the gospel themselves and they do look pretty good.</p>
<p>Last Sunday I had to go to a special branch president conference in Mar Del Plata. Although it is in another district, it is the place most central and convenient whenever they have a tri-district activity.</p>
<p>The meeting was to organize the Home Teaching Program here in the south. It was a real good meeting and everyone seemed to have a good spirit to work hard with the program in their respective branches. The meeting was held in the new chapel which was just finished (this makes 6 in the mission) and it is really beautiful. I think that I mentioned it before when I was in Necochea, but Mar Del Plata is one of the most beautiful cities I have ever been in and the new chapel fits in wonderfully.</p>
<p>The branch presidency was there from Necochea and it was wonderful to see all the members from Necochea and from Mar Del and the other branches.</p>
<p>Here in Olavarria the branch is going fine but as usual, there are quite a few problems that keep me pulling my hair out and also close to the Lord. The branch has had a problem for about three years between two factions of pride and during this period things have gotten better and then later worse. I have to watch very carefully, sometimes, in what I say or do so as to not make one or the other turn against me or show I think more of one group or the other. It is something that you wouldn’t expect to see in the Church but along with the jealous whispering and gossip I know it is there in the whole world.</p>
<p>Monday we had our missionary meeting in Tandil and did a little sightseeing afterwards. Tandil is located next to the beginning of Argentina’s mid-mountain range. It is really a beautiful city but has a huge replica of Christ on the cross and images of Christ in different points before his crucifixion all located in this path leading up a hill with the cross at the top. I have never seen so much imagination and falsehood in my life. Most of the images of the life of Christ aren’t located in the Bible and just came out of someone’s mind.
Also in Tandil there is a replica of a castle used to fight against the Indians by the Danish families that settled Tandil first – all very beautiful.</p>
<p>Well, I am running out of ideas but I do want to say I love you all and I feel very blessed to be part of the family and I hope that I never do anything that will be a disappointment to anyone.</p>
<p>May God bless all of you.</p>
<p>Love,
Gary</p>

<p>Dear Folks,</p>
<p>I have been awfully busy and I am really happy now I have a few minutes to write and tell you everything that is happening.
I can’t remember if I told Lorin and Susan “Happy Birthday from your big brother.” So I will say it now. Also, Dennis, “Happy Birthday, the 27th.”</p>
<p>Things here are progressing but a lot slower than I think they should sometimes, especially in the proselyting work. I feel sometimes that we are wasting the Lord’s time when we are tracting but I know that we will find somebody waiting for us, eventually.</p>
<p>Monday we had the missionary meeting here in Olavarria for the first time since I have been here and we went and played a little basketball afterwards – it felt good although it has been around 4 months since the last time I played.</p>
<p>Thursday 15</p>
<p>Well, I got called away and never got back to finishing the letter, but in the time elapse I received your letter of the 9th so I will try to write a little in answer to it also.</p>
<p>What is this data sheet that Daddy is making going to be used for?</p>
<p>Tommy, I am proud of you for baptizing Susan.</p>
<p>Susan, How lucky you are to be baptized in the Church of God, to have the guidance of his hand in your life. I hope and pray that we might all.</p>
<p>Last night we went out to visit the Rodriquez family. I am sure I have mentioned them before but anyway, they live out of town 7 KM (about 4+ miles) on a farm. They take care of the land for a corporation. Anyway, they don’t have any electricity and modern utensils of a farm of today and except for his truck and their portable radio, you can see the life of a 100 – 150 years ago here in Argentina in the campo. He dresses almost like the photos you see of gouchos and some of the worker do dress that way. The life is hard but refreshing. Their two kids play with the chickens, ducks, geese, lambs, dogs, cats, and horses just like I did with the neighborhood kids.</p>
<p>The family gets up and goes to bed with the sun and really are just part of nature. Still they have strong testimonies of the gospel and do all that is possible to be completely active. It makes me think about our forefathers crossing the plains and settling the west and I am sure it is somewhat the same.</p>
<p>Well, I have to go so I will say once again but not enough that I love you all so very much and hope the Lord guides us all ------- Gary.</p>

<p>Dear Folks,</p>
<p>Well, your letter of the 19th came in this morning so I thought I better sit down and write you. Thanks a lot for your letter, your prayers and your interest in my experiences as a missionary.</p>
<p>I want to mention again and again that I love you al and that you mean so much to me.</p>
<p>Things here are moving along fine My enthusiasm goes up and down with my experiences. We have met a few families that we are teaching, which help’s my spirit a lot. I sure hope we can find the way to challenge a few of them for baptism.
This program of BM for Christmas really sounds fantastic. I only wish that we could get out a few more down here. It really is the way to open a person’s desire to know the truth.</p>
<p>Also the new 6 lessons to give all new members is probably like our integration lessons but better because it isn’t up to the missionaries.</p>
<p>I really never realized how important missionaries are in the lives of the members down here. If we are down in the dumps in spirit a little the members notice it right off and if we don’t say we don’t feel very good within a couple of hrs amost it seems like the spirit of the whole branch is down.
The other day another missionary told me that I had 105 days left and it shocked me but I guess it is because I don’t want my mission to en because I enjoy it so much and also because I am scared to think of the future.</p>
<p>The world situation is really bad and it is getting worse every day. I guess it is so every time that we are in the last days and have to do so much and so fast to prepare ourselves to return to Our Father in Heaven.
I think I mentioned it before but we have been reading the Book of Mormon again as a branch and of how I love it. I finished it about 3 weeks ago and just kept on reading through the Doctrine and Covenants and I was reading a couple of days ago about marriage and the eternal covenants (sec 132) and it makes me shudder to think how really blessed we really are to be members of the Church and to have the testimonies that we have to testify to the world.</p>
<p>Give my love to Ruth and to all</p>
<p>Love always,
Gary</p>

<p>Dear Folks,</p>
<p>I have been awfully busy the past few days so now that it is raining so hard here I will take a few moments to write you.</p>
<p>I have a new companion since last Thursday. Elder Sharp was made a senior, which makes me happy to see him progress. Anyway my new companion is Elder John Dewey from Brewerton, Washington. He has been down now a little over two months and was on a “work mission” 9 months before his call to come to Argentina. In fact, he left from Salt Lake on his proselyting mission.</p>
<p>Things here are really wonderful and the Lord is blessing me so much.</p>
<p>Last night we talked with a group of people that you meet few of in your mission. I had talked to them once before but not to the extent we did last night.</p>
<p>We came in contact a few weeks ago tracting. We were tracting at night and a man came to the door and said that they were busy but would like to talk to us. I thought he looked German but I wasn’t too sure and it was a large, somewhat modern house. We went back and they were all waiting for us. Him his wife and 15-year-old daughter. And also a friend of the family. They mentioned that they were Catholic but were interested to know what the “Mormons” believed in. We found that he is the owner of a construction firm that is building most of the large apartment buildings here in Olavarria and that the friend was from B.A. (the capital). Well, we talked to them about two hours and the friend had most of the questions and answers. He seemed like a person well-read and intelligent.</p>
<p>Last night he mentioned that he had made a study of all the major religions of the world, including Mormonism. He said he believed in Jesus Christ and took the best out of [them all] to build up his belief in God. He said he had read the Book of Mormon a few years ago, along with the Bible, Koran, etc. and I challenged him to read it again. I feel so lost for words when I talk to a person like that. I know all I can do is bear my testimony, but I want so much to show him what’s right but he has to say yes or no.</p>
<p>It is sure a testimony builder to me to see how much more I have than the rest of the world and I wish I could do so much more for people like that.</p>
<p>As time goes by, even though I don’t was to, I have to think of the future. I have thought and thought about school and, although I would like to stay home and get to know the family, I think I owe it to myself to go to the Y. I have mentioned that registration is the 31st &amp; 1st, so I will have at least a week at home before school starts.</p>
<p>Time is up so love always,
Gary</p>

<p>Dear Gary,</p>
<p>Please forgive me for procrastinating so long on writing this letter. It has been Homecoming week and I have been so busy I could just die. For the past week I have been up every morning at 5:00 and have forgotten I even had a bed until about 2:00 or 3:00 the next morning. Between working on floats drawing posters for the Presidents of Ricks College, and decorating, besides the 5 D’s, Song fests, football games, snake dances, etc. school, and work, I am nearly exhausted.</p>
<p>Brother Marler left last year. He used to be Leon’s Scoutmaster and he took me fishing. We really had a great time.</p>
<p>Yes, the college is really growing. The student body is up to 2400. The buildings have really sprung up also. The new Student Union Building should be ready for next year. Where do you intend to go to school when you get home? I suppose you heard the new draft laws: only 1 missionary sent from each ward every 6 months. Boy, are they really calling the boys with the draft.</p>
<p>Allen, my returned missionary, and I are completely broken up now. It sure is a relief. Towards the last it was really a strained relationship. It might just be a good thing Cheryl [Sheryl] didn’t wait. At least you remember her at her best.</p>
<p>It sounds like you are really learning and growing form your mission. I am glad you went, not that I ever expected that you wouldn’t.</p>
<p>I had better close now as morning comes early and I still have a hundred and one things yet to do.</p>
<p>Thank you for your letters. We all enjoy them. The folks said to send their usual “hi” and well wishes.</p>
<p>Love Ya,
Di  [Diane Parson]</p>

<p>Dear Folks:</p>
<p>Well, I have been slipping again. I guess because I have two letters here on my desk that I have received since writing you last.</p>
<p>Things are really fine here and I feel wonderful. The Spirit of the Lord has really been with us the last few weeks and it really makes you feel blessed to feel His influence.
We have been doing a lot of tracting and to really look into the lives of people is really a testimony to anyone of the truth of the gospel.</p>
<p>The problems of the branch are still here that have been here for years. The jealousy and the pride and the gossip that can kill anybody. Although they are still here, I have decided to leave them and not interfere but to do more of what I am really called for – that is to challenge and baptize and to find those that the Lord is preparing for His church.</p>
<p>We have also been working, looking for a hall to hold conference in. That is district conference in December. I think we have found on and I really feel blessed because everybody told us there weren’t any. I was thinking the other day, when we walked out of the office of the president of a club, that what a difference of the Gary I knew a few years ago. The idea of talking to business leaders, etc. would have frightened me to death but now I do it without thinking because it is part of my calling to serve the Lord and that is the most important thing of my life.</p>
<p>I just thought again of some of the people that we meet tracting. And it makes me really see the power that the devil has over people to warp their way of thinking and to rationalize their way of thinking and living to feel that it is the only way and that they will arrive back in God’s presence through his grace.</p>
<p>Mom, I am really proud of you for the effort you are putting forth to help others see the truth.</p>
<p>Dennis mentioned that there are eight missionaries out from our ward now. And I guess my memory is bad or something but I can’t think of that many. Do you know who they are?</p>
<p>Well, I hate to think about it and all but the time keeps flying by so I have to make plans. Anyway, the Elders in my group are planning to travel home together as far as Lima and I wonder what you think of my traveling on the way home. The way they have it is to travel through the Indian ruins in Bolivia and Peru, including Machu Pichu, arriving in Lima on Saturday the 22nd. I am not sure of the plane schedules but I am sure I could probably get a plane from there and arrive in Washington late Saturday night. Elder Mikesell has made up his mind but I think he probably has been waiting for me. I don’t really know what I want to do but I would like to travel with the group once more but I want to be home for a few days, also.</p>
<p>Well, I have run out of ideas but I want to say I love you all very much.</p>
<p>May God bless you always,</p>
<p>Love,
Gary</p>

<p>Dear Folks:</p>
<p>I received your letters and I feel happy. Things are really moving here in Olavarria. We are planning to change buildings and are preparing for Conference in December, bedsides trying to do a little proselyting.</p>
<p>It sounds like Mother is doing some also. Keep it up, Mom.</p>
<p>On the money. Why don’t you just send the regular amount for December and send for January a little early.</p>
<p>On the trip on he way home, I decided that the time involved is more precious to be with you at home then on top of Cusco or some other place in the world, especially since school starts so soon and the money is tied down.</p>
<p>Well, I will write more later in the week; we have to go now.</p>
<p>Love, Gary</p>
</p><img data-reactid="695"/></div><div data-reactid="696"><h4 data-reactid="697"><!-- react-text: 698 -->Pdf<!-- /react-text --><!-- react-text: 699 -->: <!-- /react-text --><!-- react-text: 700 --> — <!-- /react-text --><!-- react-text: 701 -->15 Nov 1965<!-- /react-text --></h4><p data-reactid="702"><p>15/11/65</p>
<p>Dear Folks,</p>
<p>I said that I would write during the week but I didn’t get around to it so I am making sure now that I do sit down and write you.</p>
<p>I mentioned in the note that I decided not to take the trip so I guess I better explain in more detail what I meant. If I went with the rest of the Elders up through Bolivia and Peru, I would arrive home, probably on Sunday morning, at the earliest; that is Sunday the23. And since orientation at the Y starts on Friday the 28th, I would have to leave at least by Wednesday to make it in time, leaving only two or three days at home.</p>
<p>I don’t think that is enough time for the family or for me. Also, with the money situation the way it is, I would rather have it for school.</p>
<p>I still would like to stop in a few places, but probably I will arrive at home on Wednesday or Thursday, which would mean almost a week at home.</p>
<p>On the draft; I filled out a form for the Y that Ilene and Terry sent me which they use to ask for classification of students and I guess that is all I can do. I would rather just wait and if I get called, I will serve another mission, but this time for my country instead of signing up for Reserves or something and never knowing whether I will be called or not.</p>
<p>Now that time is getting short, I better mention the money situation. I have to pay rent until the day I leave and most of the other expenses will be the same. I still have the $100 in travelers checks I had when I came down but if at all possible, I think it would be just as easy to save them and use them for school. That is the reason I asked that you send January’s check early and maybe a little bigger since I would like to buy a few things to remember more of Argentina. Records, ???, etc, but since the weight situation is like it is, it can’t be too much.</p>
<p>Things here are wonderful, I feel happier and finer than I have for a long time. Maybe it is that I am working harder and maybe it is because there is more to do and I just work hard and don’t worry about it. I also have lost a little weight; now I weight about what I did when I came down but think I will feel a little bit better if I lose some more.
I mentioned that we were planning to have conference here and everyone just seems to open their doors to serve us. I sure hope some will open their hearts to the Lord, also.</p>
<p>Also, the plans for moving the branch seem pretty definite but we need to find an apartment for us and we are finding it hard to do.</p>
<p>At Branch President’s Conference yesterday, we discussed teaching in the home and they are going to start in January. The manual sure looks good. I feel a little left out that I haven’t had the lessons but I know that you have progressed with them.</p>
<p>Yesterday I went to Sacrament Meeting in Tandil, leaving my companion in charge of the branch (something that happens very often with meetings, etc.) and it made me think of the strength of testimony. Last Sunday was Fast Sunday and the whole mission had a special fast to help the  non-member Fathers to see the importance of Family unity. Well, last night in Tandil, there were two Fathers who are non-members and have never attended Church in their lives in attendance and the branch was full.
Before closing I want to say how much I love every one of you and how proud I am to represent you and the Lord here in Argentina.</p>
<p>Also, could you send me Bishop Sabin’s &amp; Pte. Smith’s addresses since I need to make sure they are the same.</p>
<p>May God bless you all
Love, Gary</p>

<p>Dear Folks,</p>
<p>Another week has gone flying by with lots of things happening.</p>
<p>The most important I guess is the missionary conference we had yesterday. We had to go to Tres Arroyos – about 5 hours ride from here. In order to get a bus we rode over to Azul – the nearest neighboring branch and there waited for a couple of hours. We left here at 10:00 at night and then sat around Azul till 2:30 in the morning and took the bus, arriving at six in the morning. The Conference lasted from 9 – 5:30 and was really wonderful. We then left at 6:30 and arrived back here at 12:00 midnight and fell into bed. Sleeping in a bed for the first time in two days, but it was all worth it because of the instructions we received and the spirit that was in the meeting.</p>
<p>I received your letters today and Congratulation on your calling as Stake missionary and Tommy, yours as Blazer teacher.</p>
<p>I am glad to hear that my permit to register arrived. The forms I don’t know anything about so I’ll leave it up to your judgement. If you don’t think that it is anything that needs to be sent in early to make arrangements, that is fine. I will look at them when I get home.</p>
<p>The work here is coming along wonderfully. The Lord is really blessing us with his guidance. I sure hope I can keep myself prepared to do His work.</p>
<p>I am going to send some books home either this or next week, so you can watch for them. They should arrive just before I do, I hope. I will tell you definitely how many packages when I send them.</p>
<p>Well, may the Lord bless you always with his blessings.</p>
<p>Your son, with love,
Gary</p>

<p>Dear Bro. and Sister Matthews,</p>
<p>We just recently returned from holding a missionary conference in the south. We spent a few hours in Olivarria with your son on our way. He is doing such a fine work and the people love him. What a thrill it is for us to talk to him and see the deep seated foundation of the Gospel that he has. You are to be complimented for the fine training that you have given him.</p>
<p>Thank you for your love and support to him. He is well and happy. They have just obtained a new place to hold services for which we are most grateful. You certainly can well be proud of this fine young man.</p>
<p>May the Lord bless you there at home as you serve with him in this great missionary work.</p>
<p>Sincerely,
Nedra H.Strong</p>

<p>Dear Folks,</p>
<p>Happy Birthday DAD one day late. As usual we have been quite busy and I haven’t taken time to sit down and write.</p>
<p>The work is going great, only we don’t seem to find any investigators who really want to know the truth even to the point of attending and taking part.</p>
<p>District Conference is this coming Saturday and Sunday and I hope everything is planned out here in Olavarria and I haven’t forgotten something. Also I mentioned that we are changing buildings and we want to do it in time for Conference so we have a few more hours cleaning the floors, waxing, etc. Also changing light fixtures from this building to the other.</p>
<p>The custom here in Argentine is that the renter buys everything and takes it with him when he leaves.</p>
<p>The weather here has cooled off the last couple of days but before it was almost unbearable to walk out on the streets. I have a good missionary tan on my neck and hands.</p>
<p>Now is the end of the year and so I am learning more of the responsibilities of being a branch president or Bishop with branch budget, tithing settlement, making out orders for manuals for next year. This really is something to try to figure how much budget each member should pay.
On the proselyting, we have given about 20 1st lessons and 6 or 7 2nd lessons in the last month but nobody has shown enough interest to make it to the baptismal font. The members are really trying to invite their friends out but are having trouble there also.</p>
<p>I really feel that the Devil feels he has this town in his pocket. I sure hope we find the key to blow it open before we (companion and I) get separated or I go home.
The Lord is being good to us but is leaving it up to us to break the shell of the town.
I just ore my old green suit through the pants so even though it was completely shot, as far as form and looks go, I am sorry to see it go since that leaves me two. On the other clothes, I am in real good condition. Garments and shirts I will bring home with me, even.</p>
<p>Well, I better get to bed so I will close now.
Write soon and love always.</p>
<p>Gary</p>
<p>P.S. I have sent 5 packages of books, papers, etc. So look for them in about a month.</p>

<p>Dear Family,</p>
<p>As another week goes flying by I feel good that we have accomplished so much. As you know, we have been planning to move the branch to another building and that conferences was supposed to have been yesterday.</p>
<p>Well, we decided with the members of the branch, to have it all prepared for conference, but the floors were in awful condition and they had to be steel wooled and cleaned good before they could be waxed and shined. We worked three or four days on the floors. Saturday morning arrived and everything had to be finished up by 11:30 and at 10:30 we finally could start moving and we finished up just as the bus arrived with the members from the other town.</p>
<p>It sure feels good to know it is done. It was a wonderful Conference. And I know the members learned lot.</p>
<p>Saturday afternoon was “kinda” rushed also. We had the Home Teaching film to present to the whole district but the man we had located here in town to show the film decided he couldn’t do itso we had 2 hrs to find someone with a 16 mm projector and it wasn’t easy, but the Lord was our guide and the members were able to see the film.</p>
<p>This coming week we will have to put more time in as missionaries and less as branch president if we want to baptize new people.
Something has happened to the mail system, as they were on strike again for a couple of days but anyway, I haven’t been getting your letters on time. I received your letter of the 29th on the 10th which is almost 6 days longer than it usually takes. Mom, you asked how long it takes a letter to reach me; usually around 6 or 7 days and I will only in Olavarria till the 14th or 15th so if you aren’t sure that the letter wouldn’t get here until later than this, you better write it to the Mission Home and I will be able to get it when I arrive there.</p>
<p>Thanks for the addresses of Pres. Smith and Bishop Sabin.</p>
<p>My companion mentioned something today that was interesting. As I mentioned before, Apostle Kimball has set a figure of 50,000 baptisms next year in South America and my companion said he can see the hand of the Lord in this because for the first year the Church has translated 75% of the programs before the year has begun and our mission, for the first time wouldn’t have to substitute other manuals or programs because of lack of new materials. Also the number of missionaries has doubled in the last year, so really now is the time. The leaders are ready for more members; the branches are ready; the missionaries are here and wanting to serve the Lord and the people are ready to listen so really there is nothing stopping the progress in S.A. [South America] in the future. I only feel bad or disappointed that I won’t be down here to see and be a part of the progress of the people.</p>
<p>The mission is also trying to prepare for a stake about the end of next year if it will be possible with enough members.</p>
<p>Christmas is beginning to be on everybody’s mind and I am sure that it is even more so there in the U.S. because of the advertising influence.</p>
<p>Well, it is getting late, so I will close and get to bed.</p>
<p>May the Lord Bless you all.
Love,
Gary</p>

<p>Dear Folks,</p>
<p>Well, another week has gone flying by and I don’t know where the time has gone.</p>
<p>I still haven’t received any word from you so I guess they are being held up by mail. I hope that there isn’t anything you want to ask me because within a couple of days, I will get home before the letter.</p>
<p>I received a letter from Ilene &amp; Terry today and they asked about my plans so I guess I ought to tell you also.</p>
<p>I am not sure exactly when the plane will arrive in Washington but it will be either Tuesday, the 18th or Wednesday the 19th. And since school starts the 28th, I will have to leave the 24th or 25th if I go by bus for the West.</p>
<p>I was just reading where it is necessary to send $25 to the Y showing that I am
accepting the going to the Y. Since I don’t know if there is a time limit, would you please send it as soon as you can. It will be part of tuition.</p>
<p>Send it to University Treasurer, D-148 A.S.B., Brigham University. Thank you.</p>
<p>I am still working hard, I think, and we are getting a lot accomplished. We should baptize that Hermana I was telling you about this week. And I hope a few more before I leave – at least find some to baptize.</p>
<p>Well, it is getting late so I will close.
See you in a couple of weeks.</p>
<p>Love always,
Gary</p>
<p>P.S.  Remember the check to the Y with a note saying it is for me.</p>

<p>Dear Folks,</p>
<p>I am really sorry that I have been lazy and put off writing letters. Last week I was quite busy and when I don’t get letters written on Mondays, it is almost an unearthly thing to try to get them done later in the week.</p>
<p>Last Monday we went on a picnic with the family we had just baptized out in the country. We must have walked for miles and miles. I had never really gone out in the nature before like we did then. It is just beautiful out there. I come to love Argentina more and more every day.</p>
<p>I really feel blessed of the Lord to be here, especially here in this branch. The people here are just wonderful and we have more contacts than I have had at one time during my whole mission. Right now we are working with three families and two or three jovens and I am sure that some of them will join the church.</p>
<p>On your questions on the address. I am sorry that my handwriting has been an obstacle to you and I will try to do better. My address is this:
Monobloc 3 Manzana 3 Dto. 2
Seción 1, Circumscicion 1
Ciudad Belgrano, Ezeiza,
Partido Matanza, Provincia B.B.
Aregentina
In English
Apartment building 3, Block 3, Ap. #2
Section 1, Aerea 1
(Town) City
County, State
Country</p>
<p>That is the complete address. Now all of it is not needed. The parts of Ezeiza, or Partido Matanza, but it would be better to use it all.</p>
<p>The Lord’s work is really moving along great down here and time is going by so fast I wonder if I will have accomplished the purpose of my mission before it is time to go home. Elders that were juniors when I came down are finishing their missions now and it scares me to death.</p>
<p>Give my love to Ruth, will you. How is shoe doing, any way? Fine, I hope.</p>
<p>Also you will be getting in a little bit bate but have a Happy Anniversary tomorrow. It’s you 24th. NO!</p>
<p>Monday we played basketball against some members of the branch and it almost killed me! I ache all over today but I felt good doing a little physical activity again.</p>
<p>Well, I will close for now</p>
<p>Love always,
Gary</p>
<p>P.S.  I am enclosing a picture of my companion that we had taken in a park in one of the towns here in our branch.</p>
